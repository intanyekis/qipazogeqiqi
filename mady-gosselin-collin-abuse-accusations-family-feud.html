However, she reiterated that she does not plan to rehabilitate her relationship with her younger brother, claiming that he “reached the point of physical violence and hate speech.” <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has reached out to a lawyer for Jon Gosselin, who had custody of Collin before he turned 18, for comment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Collin has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been estranged</a> from six of his seven <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>siblings</a> since he was sent to a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>psychiatric facility</a> in 2016. He eventually moved in with Jon, who was awarded sole physical and legal custody of the then-minor in 2018.&nbsp;<strong>Hannah Gosselin</strong>, another one of Jon and Kate’s sextuplets, also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>moved in with her dad</a>. Mady and her twin sister,&nbsp;<strong>Cara Gosselin</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lived with Kate</a> and the four other sextuplets —&nbsp;<strong>Alexis Gosselin, Aaden Gosselin, Joel Gosselin</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Leah Gosselin</strong> — before leaving for college.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>While appearing on&nbsp;Dark Side of the 2000s, Collin <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>blamed Kate</a> for his estrangement from six of his siblings. He claimed that Kate sent him to the psychiatric facility because he was starting to tell others that she was allegedly abusive. “She caught wind of that and had to put me somewhere where I wouldn’t be able to get the secrets out,” Collin alleged. He also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>claimed that Kate</a> told his siblings “the story one way,” which allegedly “drove a social barrier” between them.&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> reached out to a rep for Kate for comment on these accusations, as well.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-11></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by Jon Gosselin (@jongosselin1)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Kate has previously denied Collin’s abuse claims, telling&nbsp;Good Morning America in 2016, “I’ve been investigated many times.

Although she did not make abuse allegations, she said that Kate “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>separated</a>” Collin from the rest of the siblings. “He would not get to come outside and play with us,” she said on&nbsp;Dark Side of the 2000s. “He would eat dinner at different times than us. I don’t think effort was made in the home to help him learn what behavior is acceptable and what behavior is not acceptable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FpZqaZlK56qLvSrJyloZ5isLC4y6KlZpmSqsCmecCcmq6rkam2sLrSZp2apZmhxm6yxK6baA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./micheal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Micheal, Author at Popular Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./up-and-coming-celebrities-under-18.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Up And Coming Celebrities Who Are 18 Or Younger</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
