His <a href=#>Netflix</a> hit <a href=#>Emily in Paris was bashed by the French media</a> after its season 1 release in 2020. Sex and the City's reboot And Just Like That also received flak when it aired on December 9, 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The HBO Max original has been picked apart for its <a href=#>cringe-worthy wokeness fans blame on bad writing</a>. We all know the original series hasn't aged well in the past years. However, the attempt for redemption just made it worse, with The Daily Mail saying "Sex and the City died of wokeness." Along with it went Mr. Big <a href=#>whose Peloton death was just as bad</a>. It's halfway into season 1 and a lot of things still don't make sense for viewers. They figured it was because of this missing iconic SATC element.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Are Calling ‘And Just Like That…’ More Realistic Than ‘Sex And The City’</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-want-carrie-39-s-voiceovers-back-in-39-and-just-like-that-39>Fans Want Carrie's Voiceovers Back In 'And Just Like That'</h2><p>We couldn't help but wonder... How come the writers got rid of Carrie Bradshaw's voiceovers when it's probably the most memed SATC bit that has immortalized the show all these years?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans took to the show's official subreddit to express their thoughts on the missing voiceovers. "Is it just me or the show could feel more genuine with Carrie's voiceovers?" wrote a Redditor. "I feel like without them the show has lost some of its [sense]." Even prior to the reboot's release, fans were using "I couldn't help but wonder" memes to express their speculations on the show's new twists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, one of the reasons we loved SATC was because we got to follow Carrie's life in New York City. It's not the same without her musings. "The show feels very quiet without them," a fan noticed. "And there’s often no smooth transition between scenes without them." Also, let's admit it, Sarah Jessica Parker has a nice voice. Why take that away now, just when ASMRs are already a thing? Let's hope they bring back those voiceovers in season 2 (if they ever get a renewal amid the backlash).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'And Just Like That': Cynthia Nixon Reacts To That Miranda Twist In Episode Five</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-39-and-just-like-that-39-get-rid-of-carrie-39-s-voiceovers>Why Did 'And Just Like That' Get Rid Of Carrie's Voiceovers?</h2><p>Michael Patrick King, the show's director, hasn't disclosed the reason for this choice. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Screen Rant</a>, it's probably because some voiceovers in the SATC movies "felt repetitive and stiff."</p><p>Carrie also had this cheesy closing line, "dressed head to toe in love" in the first movie. The second movie was a tone-deaf disaster, too. We're pretty sure it's one of the reasons AJLT is trying so hard to appear woke. With so much to make up for, King probably just thought it would be safe to get rid of Carrie's voiceovers. Carrie had some pretty controversial reflections, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, the stylish (still up for debate) New Yorker hasn't also stopped sounding entitled and demanding. Perhaps the writers thought the voiceovers would have only got Carrie canceled in this climate. It's probably why she's also quit writing. Frankly, her judgmental nature wouldn't cut it in today's sex-positive media. Still, fans are hoping to see her get back on her desk and write her thoughts on modern dating. The whole post-pandemic dating scene would make some interesting content. Seriously, just give Carrie her own domain.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'And Just Like That...’: Here’s What Cynthia Nixon Really Thinks Of Samantha’s Absence</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carrie-39-s-voiceovers-would-make-39-and-just-like-that-39-better>Carrie's Voiceovers Would Make 'And Just Like That' Better</h2><p>Carrie's voiceovers would not only make up for her lack of writing in AJLT. Fans also believe that it would save the entire sequel (well maybe a little bit). Fans think that without the voiceovers, the characters just seem less relatable. One Redditor even made a good analogy for how important this iconic element is. "I feel like they're a huge part of the show that's why it feels weird to watch and not have that Carrie comment," they wrote. "Like for example Grey's Anatomy if you remove Meredith's POV it would be weird. Before I used to feel like I was inside Carrie's mind and now I'm just an outsider if that makes sense." That's exactly how it feels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But some fans remain optimistic about the voiceovers. One of them said that it would probably come back and that Carrie had just "lost her voice" for now. That's kind of a brilliant theory, really. Maybe we'll get the voiceovers once she's found a new home and gotten over Big's tragic death. Another fan claims that "the official argument [for the lack of voiceovers] is that [Carrie's] no longer the central part of the story." However, we understand why many fans aren't buying it. They just feel like until now, Carrie is still that same self-centered friend. Hopefully, that's now up for a rewrite.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest 'And Just Like That...'
