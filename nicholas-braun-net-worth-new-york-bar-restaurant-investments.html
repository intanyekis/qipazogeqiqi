While some ride the coattails of their fame, others incorporate cherished family recipes into their menus or find ways to give back to their communities. Several <a href=#>celebrities own gourmet restaurants and some even have Michelin stars</a>. However, for Nicholas Braun, his business venture into New York's vibrant culinary scene is more of a childhood dream.</p><p>Although he played the underdog as <a href=#>Cousin Greg in HBO's Succession in all four seasons</a>, Braun in real life backs his words with actions. The actor funneled both his investments and his $5 million net worth into various bars and restaurants, including Pebble Bar, Ray's, Jac's on Bond, and S&P Lunch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-many-bars-and-restaurants-does-nicholas-braun-own>How Many Bars And Restaurants Does Nicholas Braun Own?</h2><p>After <a href=#>Nicholas Braun called his fans on Instagram to support rock opera</a>, he displayed a remarkable knack for business decisions. Braun has invested in four culinary establishments in New York City. The first bar, Downstairs at Ray's is situated just beneath the original bar and exudes a speakeasy vibe. However, it's not a fancy secret club or an opulent lounge, it's basically a basement space transformed into a bar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nicholas-braun-succession-event.jpg><p>Joined by fellow investors Jon Neidich and Carlos Quirarte, Braun simply seeks a place where everyone can gather and relax.</p><p>"I struggle with where to go in New York," Braun explained in W Magazine. "It's hard to find a place where you're not screaming over other people, or it's so loud that you can't even have a conversation—where you're just sort of looking at people, wishing you could talk to them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braun's Pebble Bar, which opened in 2022, is an establishment spanning three stories of a townhouse in New York City, formerly the location of Hurley's.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The space has been transformed into an intimate, stylish setting and is supported by his fellow restaurateurs</a> Noah Bernamoff, Carlos Quirarte, Matt Kliegman, Julian Brizzi, Matthew Charles, and SNL's Pete Davidson.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from Ray's, Braun intends to infuse the Pebble Bar vision with lessons learned.</p><p>"Ray's is such a different vibe. Who knows, though, it could get pretty raucous in here… You think you’re going to go in for one drink, and you spend the whole night there. There’s something transportive about it. I hope that's what this becomes."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Nicholas Braun Really Feels About His Most Famous Scene In 'Succession'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Braun collaborated with Authentic Hospitality in his new Manhattan bar, Jac's on Bond. According to Grubstreet, the actor's team has transformed an 1831 townhouse into an elegant bar featuring pool tables and inventive cocktails.</p><p>Lastly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Braun channeled his investment into a small restaurant called S&P</a>. According to Food and Wine, S&P is a timeless, straightforward diner with an old-school charm. Originally established in 1928 as S&P Sandwich Shop, the establishment changed hands numerous times before concluding its run as Eisenberg's during the pandemic.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-nicholas-braun-earn-from-his-bar-and-restaurant-investments>How Much Does Nicholas Braun Earn From His Bar And Restaurant Investments?</h2><p>While the specific earnings of Nicholas Braun from his investments in bars and restaurants remain undisclosed, a series of discussions in Quora gives an idea of how much profit investors make in a restaurant business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, the initial investment needed to establish a full-service restaurant exhibits a broad spectrum, spanning from $200,000 to $2,000,000, contingent on the extent of investment in aspects like interiors and kitchen equipment.
