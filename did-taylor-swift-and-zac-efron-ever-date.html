Because it was publicized from 2011 to 2012 that Swift was romantically linked to Jake Gyllenhaal and Conor Kennedy, many tried to make that this romance flew under the radar. The man that Swift was supposedly involved with during this time was <strong><a href=#>Zac Efron</a></strong>. Because of his high-profile relationships and chemistry with Swift, it did not appear to be a rumor out of the realm of possibilities. This is perhaps why the rumor, to this day, refuses to die.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Zac Efron Know Rita Ora Would Rip Off His Shirt During An Awards Ceremony?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the same timeframe that Swift was dating Gyllenhaal and Kennedy, Efron was linked to two separate women as well. In 2011, Efron was newly single having ended his long-term relationship with Vanessa Hudgens, and was rumored to be dating Lily Collins in the year that followed. With Swift and Efron spending a good deal of time together professionally, rumors of a budding romance began and were fueled with pictures and stories from the paparazzi. The rumors left fans divided on whether Swift and Efron were an item or not.</p><h2 id=zac-efron-and-taylor-swift-co-starred-in-39-the-lorax-39>Zac Efron And Taylor Swift Co-Starred In 'The Lorax'</h2><p>Efron and Swift met after they both worked as voice actors on The Lorax. However, it was not until the two began to promote the film together that tongues began wagging that there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more going on between the Baywatch star and Swift than the duo was letting on</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/untitled-design-14-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Swift has been talking about him non-stop since her breakup with Tom [Hiddleston]," a source explained about the relationship between Swift and Efron. "She’s always said she feels a strong connection to Zac, but could never act on it because they’ve always been dating other people."</p><p>The source went on to say, "Taylor and Zac have always been pretty flirty with each other. She’s reached out to Zac and told him that they should hang out and maybe go to dinner together, and he’s into it. It just hasn’t happened yet because of their schedules."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Any Of Taylor Swift's Songs About Her Famous Friends Other Than That "When Emma Falls In Love" Rumor?</a></span></p><p>Of course when rumors like this start, it is hard to shut them down, much like with <a href=#>Efron having plastic surgery to alter his face</a>.

And when this happened, shutting down rumors became all but impossible to do.</p><p>"He [Zac] has been letting his friends know that he is down to see what Taylor is all about," a source revealed. "He likes her <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> and thinks she is sexy so he is telling friends he is curious what it would be like to have Taylor Swift as a girlfriend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49139957-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans who <a href=#>like to rate Swift's current boyfriends and exes</a> jumped on this bandwagon and tried to push that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift's Girl at Home dealt with the relationship between the two</a>.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when she called him "awesome,"</a> the tabloids seemingly forgot the rest of the comment that Swift made in which she clarified where their relationship stood, even with Efron sitting right next to her on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>"He is awesome; we are not a couple, though," Swift explained. "You hear people get together when they're shooting movies ... co-stars ... but not animated movie co-stars, you know what I'm saying?
