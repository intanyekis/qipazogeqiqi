She further explained that she's not a filmmaker who could picture the final look.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I'm quite glad that I didn't feel that before because I never felt that I needed to incite fear: I felt a lot of empathy for this woman. She’s got a mission, and she’s going for it," she continued.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Screenshot-7.png></p><p>According to the actress, Maud was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">complete character</a>, and it made so much sense that she never looked into the darkness of anything. She felt that her character flowed smoothly, and she knew where she needed to go with it.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Clark basically fell in love with her on-screen persona. "I'm quite fascinated by the health service, in terms of the privatization of that and what that means in terms of mental health support, and the fascinating aspect of religion, so I was just obsessed with it.", she added.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Clark as Maud</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In the movie, Clark portrays Maud, a devout nurse obsessed with saving an ill woman's life. Though she is committed to her work, her religious faith that she&nbsp;acquires&nbsp;after a previous patient's death makes her a source of amusement for many.&nbsp;</p><p>Even for the BAFTA-nominated star, it was a fascinating idea and a trip into the unknown. "I know people who've both lost their faith, and people who found faith,’' she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Grazia</a>, "and I'm neither of them. I've always found that concept quite mind-boggling."</p><p>The 32-year-old is perhaps <a href=# rel=follow>best known for her role in</a> Saint Maud.&nbsp;The 2019 horror movie won&nbsp;her the 'Dublin Film Critics Circle Award&nbsp;(DFCC) for Breakthrough Artist 2019' and 'London Critics Circle Film Award (ALFS) for British/Irish Actress of the year 2021.' She also managed to gather five nominations, including two BAFTA nominations for 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Clark's Upcoming Movie&nbsp;</h2><p>After the tremendous success of Saint Maud, Clark has earned a lead role in Amazon's new series, Lord of the Rings.</p><p>According to December 2019 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> from Variety, His Dark Materials actress would play young Galadriel, the Elven Queen&nbsp;played by Cate Blanchett in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Morfydd-Clark-and-Cate-Blanchett.jpg><p>In fact, Clark spent the 2020 lockdown days with the television series's crew members&nbsp;in New Zealand. Even though it was strange for her to spend lockdown time with the people she barely knew, she was certain to stay there for the opportunity she got. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Clark <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">told</a> NME in September 2020 via Zoom: “It was very clear that I needed to stay here. I’ve certainly been homesick, but it’s a really small cross to bear in comparison to what’s going on at the moment.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eup8DAZqWopZmjsqZ5zKipn7GUmXqkuMCromahnqmys7HSrZydZZiquqK6jKyYoqakYrqiwcNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-whitlock-lebron-james-racism-515892.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Whitlock Says LeBron James' &amp;quot;Wealth Shields Him&amp;quot; From Racism</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-camelia-katoozian-i-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All About Camelia Katoozian I Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
