Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were fantastic working alongside one another, and there is just no way that Harry and Lloyd would have caught on with audiences, in the same way, had they been played by any other duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Released in December 1994, the film, which carried a modest budget, would go on to make <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $250 million globally</a>. This was a huge amount of success for the film to find, and it marked the third smash hit that Jim Carrey had during that calendar year.</p><p>A lot of comedies don't hold up well over the years, but this is one movie that remains just as funny as ever. This is largely thanks to the collective performance given by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. They were an odd pairing, but one that completely made the movie what it was.</p><p>Just one year later, the film got a cartoon spin-off show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Jim Carrey Rejected Comedians For Jeff Daniels In 'Dumb And Dumber'</a></span></p><h2 id=39-dumb-and-dumber-39-got-its-own-animated-show-for-one-season-in-the-39-90s>'Dumb And Dumber' Got Its Own Animated Show For One Season In The '90s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/34E03575-3AB7-487F-9333-90E9E1C62949.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In what may come as a complete surprise to fans, there was a Dumb and Dumber animated show that was brought to the small screen during the 1990s. Clearly, the network thought that they had a great idea, but as we will soon learn, this show never really gained any semblance of traction with fans.</p><p>To the show's credit, it did debut in 1995, which was just one year after the movie caught lightning in a bottle. It was apparent that the network was trying to strike while the iron was hot, but at the end of the day, this show only managed to air a single season on ABC.</p><p>One of the primary things working against the show was its voice cast. Yes, talented people were placed into the lead roles, but not having Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels on board effectively sank this project before it ever had a real chance of taking off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, it came and went without making much noise. Episodes can still be purchased on some digital marketplaces, and clips can also be found online. Give them a watch to see how odd this show was.</p><p>While some people may find it strange that the movie got a spin-off cartoon, the truth is that several of Jim Carrey's movies got animated shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Crowds Tried To 'Violently' Attack Jim Carrey At His Stand-Up Shows</a></span></p><h2 id=it-wasn-39-t-the-first-time-jim-carrey-films-had-cartoons>It Wasn't The First Time Jim Carrey Films Had Cartoons</h2><p>At this point, the monumental success that Jim Carrey found in 1994 has been covered quite a bit. That year, the actor starred in Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. All three of those movies would get animated projects on the small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For 3 seasons and just over 40 episodes, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was a modestly-successful show that earned some fans. Once again, Jim Carrey did not take part in voicing the character that he played on the big screen, but this show was significantly more successful than Dumb and Dumber was.</p><p>The Mask was another show that lasted for three seasons, but it was able to deliver nearly 55 episodes while it was still on the air. Much like the other two shows, this series debuted in 1995, and some would say that this was perhaps the most successful of the three. To be fair, it also had the backing of the comic book community.</p><p>Realistically, none of these shows went on to rival any of the classic shows from the 1990s. For the most part, people have largely forgotten about all three of them. That being said, the fact that two of these shows managed to last for three seasons is still pretty impressive in some way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Are Still Talking About This Weird Jim Carrey Interview</a></span></p><p>If you ever go back to watch any of Jim Carrey's 1994 comedy hits, just know that the animated shows are out there and could function as a fun way to kill some time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Major Star Revealed They Want To Film An Intimate Scene With Jim Carrey</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibrqWSYq6vsIydrKaalad6orrIppitnZRiwKa%2ByJ6qZq%2BYlsFutMCpp56mlZl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./50-cent-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 Cent Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./keegan-allen-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Keegan Allen Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
