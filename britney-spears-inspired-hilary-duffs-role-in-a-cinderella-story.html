At a school Halloween dance, she discovers that her online pen pal is none other than the captain of the football team, Austin Ames (<strong>Chad Michael Murray</strong>). Rather than lose a shoe, Sam loses her cell phone while fleeing the dance to make it back to her late father’s diner before curfew.</p><p>While Sam plans to reveal her identity to Austin at the right moment, she is exposed at a school pep rally by her stepsisters and Austin’s evil ex, Shelby (<strong>Julie Gonzalo</strong>). The reveal leads to one of the movie’s most memorable moments in which Sam calls out Austin in the boys’ locker room, uttering the iconic line, “Waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought, useless and disappointing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Britney-Spears-Was-the-Inspiration-for-Hilary-Duff-s-A-Cinderella-Story-Character-Screenwriter-Reveals-864.jpg><p>According to Dunlap, the scene was one of the hardest to nail. “We went through so many rewrites of that because we went into production so quickly,” she explained. “They brought in other writers to write on stuff too. That scene went through many, many forms because it was the big scene of the whole movie. It was something we all worked on a lot.”</p><p>A personal favorite line of Dunlap’s is the phrase Sam’s father (<strong>Whip Hubley</strong>) shared with her — “Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game” — which ultimately motivates Sam to stand up to her stepmother.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As the film celebrated its 20th anniversary, Dunlap says it “excited” her that A Cinderella Story still holds a special place in fans’ hearts. “When you write something and somebody actually says it means something to them, it’s the greatest feeling in the world. It just means so much. It touches me,” she gushed. “I can’t believe it’s been 20 years, and new people are discovering it. Old people are rediscovering it. It’s so cool that somebody is literally sitting on a plane on Delta watching the movie. That is the coolest.”</p><p>A Cinderella Story also starred <strong>Regina King</strong>, <strong>Dan Byrd</strong>, <strong>Simon Helberg</strong>, <strong>Brad Bufanda</strong>, <strong>Mary Pat Gleason</strong> and <strong>Lin Shaye</strong>, among others. Murray, 42, wished the film a “Happy 20 year anniversary” via his instagram Story on Tuesday by reposting pics from Austin and Sam’s dance scene to <strong>Edwin McCain</strong>’s “I’ll Be.”</p><p>The original spawned several spinoff films: 2008’s Another Cinderella Story starring <strong>Selena Gomez</strong>, 2011’s A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song starring <strong>Lucy Hale</strong>, 2016’s A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits starring <strong>Sofia Carson</strong>, 2019’s A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish starring <strong>Laura Marano</strong> and 2021’s A Cinderella Story: Starstruck starring <strong>Bailee Madison</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmroaSjsrp50qmcmqqjYravv8%2BiqZ6cXZ22ra3RsmSdrZabwG6%2BzqWcZqGeYq5ur8inm56qlaG5onnSraarsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-star67-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drake Star67 Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barry-sanders-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-491587-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barry Sanders Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
