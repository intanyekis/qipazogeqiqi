He led the Sooners to a national championship in 2000, and all of his endeavors have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Bob Stoops? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $12 million, mostly earned through success as a coach, as he reportedly earns $5 million per year as the head coach at the University of Oklahoma. He’s held various coaching positions at several schools and as he continues his career it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Bob Stoops Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>Stoops attended Cardinal Mooney High School and matriculated in 1978. His father was the defensive coordinator of the school’s football team; Bob later attended the University of Iowa. He started in the football team all four years, and became a one-time All-Big Ten selection. In 1983, he graduated with a marketing degree, and started working as a volunteer coach in the Iowa Hawkeyes Program.</p><p>Bob then became an assistant at Kent State University, before joining the staff at Kansas State University in 1989. Three years later, he became the co-defensive coordinator, and after four years would become assistant head coach. He helped the Wildcats in their most impressive turnaround, turning the team into a national competitor. During his last four seasons with them, they had a record of 35-12 along with three bowl appearances. His net worth was well established.</p><p>He then went to the University of Florida, and became the defensive coordinator for the next three years; he was given full control of the Gators defense and was responsible for helping the team win a national championship – the 1997 Sugar Bowl. During his time there, his stock rose considerably, and he became known as one of the top coaching names in college football. In 1999, he was in contention to become head coach as he was at the top of the list of assistant coaches during the time.</p><p>However, he was named as the head coach at the University of Oklahoma, and would proceed to win seven games during his first year. During his 17 year tenure, he compiled an 80.4 percent record at 179-46, surpassing<a href=#> Barry Switzer</a> for most wins as a coach at Oklahoma and would set a home winning streak of 39 consecutive games from 2005 to 2011. In 2000, he led the Sooners to a BCS National Championship with an undefeated record. Under his leadership, the Sooners would appear in various Bowl games including the Bowl Championship Series, Sugar Bowl, and Orange Bowl. His team has had more BCS National Championship Game appearances than any other in the country, considerably enhancing his net worth along the way.</p><p>Due to his success, he was given the nickname “Big Game Bob” and would win eight Big 12 Conference Championships. In 2008, the Sooners became the highest scoring team in college football, scoring a total of 716 points at an average of 51 points per game. He became one of the highest paid coaches in college football, and was even invited to join several NFL teams, but declined.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Bob is married to Carol Stoops and they have three children. His younger brother is Mike Stoops who is the defensive coordinator of the Sooners. The youngest, Mark Stoops is the head coach of the University of Kentucky and their older brother Ron Jr. is an assistant football coach at the Youngstown State University.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.431818181818><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Bob Stoops</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 9, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Youngstown, Ohio, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American Football coach</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Iowa, Cardinal Mooney High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Carol Stoops</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Mackenzie Stoops, Isaac Stoops, Drake Stoops</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Evelyn Stoops, Ron Stoops Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Mike Stoops, Mark Stoops, Maureen Stoops, Ron Stoops Jr., Kathy Stoops</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Robert Anthony Stoops</td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ou_coachstoops</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1655370/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Head coach of the University of Oklahoma's football team, 1999-present.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=26.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Believer</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2013 AT&T Cotton Bowl</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself -
