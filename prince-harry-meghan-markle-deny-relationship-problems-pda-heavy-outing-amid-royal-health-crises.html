<strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their way to the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in Wellington, Florida, on Friday, April 12, where they were greeted with cause for celebration. While Harry was participating in the charity polo match, Markle was watching from the sidelines, proving to be his biggest cheerleader as she encouraged him.</p><p>Following a 3-1 victory for Harry's team against the Grand Champions, Markle, 42, joined him in the winner's circle, presenting a special trophy. Witnesses captured a tender moment between the couple as they leaned in for a kiss to commemorate his triumph.</p><p>Markle dressed herself for the occasion in a white Heidi Merrick halter dress paired with statement sunglasses and Aquazarra heels. Meanwhile, Harry, 39, donned a blue button-down shirt with white trousers and a tan blazer before suiting up in his polo attire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-03-at-8-13-28-am.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Meghan Markle’s New Brand Mocked As A “Senior Living Facility” As It Financially Flops">Meghan Markle’s New Brand Mocked As A “Senior Living Facility” As It Financially Flops</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Markle's brand may have launched before it was ready as it's not getting the reaction she hoped for.</p><p>The polo match, attended by over 300 guests including Serena Williams, served as a fundraiser for Sentebale, a charity co-founded by Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006. Sentebale's mission is to assist African children affected by poverty, inequality, and HIV/AIDS, making the event a meaningful endeavor for all involved, especially given that Harry’s mother did a lot of charity and activism work to support HIV/AIDS research in her lifetime.</p><p>According to reports, Harry and Meghan were accompanied by cameras, making their display of the affection literally for the cameras, and not just paparazzi ones. It’s unclear what project the couple were filming for, but it’s likely one of the Netflix shows they recently announced.</p><h2 id=harry-and-meghan-may-have-been-filming-for-their-new-netflix-shows>Harry And Meghan May Have Been Filming For Their New Netflix Shows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this month, their production company Archewell confirmed the couple actively <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">involved in the production of two nonfiction series</a> for Netflix as part of the $100 million deal they signed with the streaming platform years ago.</p><p>The initial endeavor features Meghan, showcasing her passion for cooking and entertaining. Meanwhile, the second series delves into the realm of professional polo, with significant portions filmed during the U.S. Open Polo Championship.</p><p>Both shows, which are currently without titles and release dates, will have Harry and Meghan serving as executive producers.</p><p>Despite Harry and Meghan’s joint outing, <a href=#>the prince traveled alone to the U.K. earlier this year</a> after King Charles’ cancer was announced. Though reports say Harry wants to reconcile with his family, and some theories even claim <a href=#>he’s contemplating a move back to England</a>, it’s suspected that Markle may not be as on board, especially given other reports that says he’s focusing on resuming her acting career in California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinq6GemLJutMCrqbJlnZq0qa3NZqSaqpuhsm6wxKewZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK9s7vBpZymq12lsaJ5x56Yr7FdpMK1tc2gZJqlmZl6s7vYmqNmoJWWubW0jJypoquVqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./v-exclusive-trae-tha-truth-talks-working-lil-wayne-rick-ross-jadakiss-and-more-pg-3-45030.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trae Tha Truth Talks Working With Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Jadakiss, And More [Pg. 3]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-jordan-through-the-years-nba-space-jam-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Jordan Through the Years: NBA, 'Space Jam' and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
