No one will believe that Sheila didn’t manipulated Sugar into this. They have tried to redeem Sheila and this may be one of the ways. The viewers are pushing back and I am one of them. I can’t see Sheila interacting with no one but Deacon.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>I think that Sheila’s plan was that Sugar would kill Steffy while Sheila was off with someone that could give her an air tight alibi but unfornately Steffy killed the the Sheila look alike. So Sheila went into hiding.</p><p>I am trying to remember if Sugar was a prison guard with training on how to take down a prisoner?</p><p>For something that was suppose to be a big twist this was a big dud. It would have been a bigger twist if the corpse had 9 toes and that it really was Sheila.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><p>I get ya, but I can’t help but feel at this point, Sheila will be portrayed as a victim. Some kind of abduction. My best guess would be that if someone (Sugar) had been gullible or feeble enough to undergo surgery to look like Sheila, then perhaps she does indeed think she is Sheila. And Sheila’s enemies are her enemies. It will undoubtedly be interesting to see how this all plays out, regardless.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 5, 2024, 8:55pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>But then why should Sheila disappear? Why wouldn’t she just stick around as she was the victim of Sugar’s delusions and not the one who broke into the Cliff House or attempted to hurt Steffy.</p><p>BTW, how would Sugar know that Steffy was Sheila’s enemy if someone didn’t inform her of that?</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 5, 2024, 9:02pm <span itemprop=position>6</span></span><p>There really isn’t a way to redeem Sheila adequately at this point—she’s been a full-on sociopath/psychopath on not one show but two, as they just reminded everyone with Lauren’s flashbacks, for over thirty years. The possibility of her being “cured” is slim to none—and every time she makes any kind of progress, it takes barely anything at all to set her off yet again. Deacon just looks crazy for wanting to be involved with her, and even he was having second thoughts right before she supposedly died.</p><p>She’d also have an awful lot of explaining to do—why did she just disappear like that? Why did she let everyone think she’d died yet again? Who was the person who looked exactly like her whom Steffy killed? Why did that person break into the Cliff House and go after Steffy? No one, except maybe Deacon, and probably not even him, is going to believe Sheila has no explanations for any of that.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I am also thinking that Sheila might be portrayed as Sugar’s victim. Maybe Sugar injured Sheila in someway. These writers love to repeat things so maybe Sheila is somewhere injured (without her memory) much the way that Li was a while back after Sheila attempted to kill Li.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I have little doubt that Sheila will be rescued from a dire situation in which a mentally incapacitated Sugar put her in. Remember, this is a soap opera. Not reality, nor anything close to an Academy Award winning writing in a dramatic movie.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I just have to ask, because it must have been a time when I wasn’t watching B&B, but who is Sugar and how was she involved with Sheila?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Max</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 5, 2024, 11:05pm <span itemprop=position>10</span></span><p>Had Sugar killed Stephanie, Sheila would’ve been free and clear because like you said she would’ve been elsewhere with an alibi.</p><p>I believe that Sugar was the warden but not sure. Sheila manipulated her children into doing her bidding which is why she weren’t directly involved. She never does her dirt with witnesses around.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Max</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 5, 2024, 11:10pm <span itemprop=position>11</span></span><p>Deacon couldn’t explain why Sheila would have broken it since he thought she was on the right path of doing good. They will most definitely come up with a lame story for Sheila disappearance.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Sugar is a warden who helped Sheila Carter to escape from the prison. Sheila and Sugar kidnapped Ridge Forrester. His half brother, and his wife, Brooke Logan tried to save Ridge, but they also were caught by Sheila and Sugar. Nick flirted with Sugar so he, Ridge and Brooke will be able to escape, but his plan was foiled by Sheila. Ridge and Nick’s father, Massimo Marrone comes to save them, and Sheila tells him that they have a daughter together; Diana Carter, but then Sheila and Sugar flee with Diana.</p><p>In Genoa City, it is revealed that Sheila had tricked Sugar into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and she also turned Sugar in to the police, and so Sugar is sent to prison in place of Sheila. After Sugar escaped, she stabbed Scotty Grainier in an attempt to kill him. Unfortunately for her, the police showed up and arrested her. At the police station discovered that the woman isn’t Sheila at all. Sheila’s ankle was broken, so she couldn’t be able to walk without crutches. Sugar then explained what Sheila did to her and said she “wanted to destroy the one thing that ever meant anything to Sheila”. After that she was taken away by the police and locked behind bars.</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>Thank you so much, Chricker. I don’t remember any of that and I’ve watched Bold from the first episode.

I think Sheila is being held captive somewhere and it is going to be the start of a Sheila redemption storyline. Obviously it wasn’t Sheila that broke into Sinn’s house so the last act of violence was on Steffy’s part now Sheila.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 6, 2024, 1:16pm <span itemprop=position>16</span></span><p>If that’s the case—that Sugar’s last declaration was that she wanted to destroy the one thing that meant anything to Sheila—why would she go after Steffy? It’s not like it wouldn’t please Sheila no end if Steffy were killed. We also heard someone say, in Sheila’s voice, that this would be night Steffy died. Does Sugar also sound like Sheila?</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Yes. And she has 10 toes.</p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/50afbb/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Cooper:<p>We also heard someone say, in Sheila’s voice, that this would be night Steffy died. Does Sugar also sound like Sheila?</p><p>Good point. This Sugar, whom I don’t really remember, might have had plastic surgery to look like Sheila but no two voices are the same. Similar, maybe. Sugar could have been working for Sheila and said that line because for all Steffy knew she would have killed Sheila. And even as I read that back it sounds odd. i haven’t got a clue, tbh.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Harbor</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 7, 2024, 9:35am <span itemprop=position>19</span></span><p>Sheila did say she was meeting someone from her past that she reconnected with. Deacon had pretty much told Sheila they were never going to commit because of Hope and that he was having second thoughts. Maybe Sugar convinced Sheila to leave town and start over. Sugar decided to take out Steffy on her own and got killed in the process instead. Sheila had already taken off not knowing Sugar tried to kill Steffy and is now living somewhere starting a new life unaware she is in fact thought to be dead. But now that Deaon knows shes probably alive will go find her and bring her home. How Sheila explains not knowing about Sugar is wierd but doable. By then Hope will have snagged Finn and then SHE can have Sheila for a mommy and Finn will be sooooo grateful she didnt die he will refuse to cut her out of his life any longer. Sets up drama for Steffy over Hayes as well.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>JamO</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 8, 2024, 2:27am <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>I remember Sheila telling Deacon that she was going to see someone.
