Johnny was initially awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages, while Amber got $2 million in compensatory damages for her countersuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to a Virginia statute capping compensatory damages, Amber was originally going to have to pay $10.3 million. But she was quick to appeal the decision amid reports her <a href=#>insurance was refusing to cover the damages</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Johnny and Amber’s legal teams reached an agreement in December where her debt owed was reduced to $1 million in exchange for her to stop appealing the case.</p><p><a href=#>Amber defended her decision to settle</a>, saying, “I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder.”</p><p>She added that it was “not an act of concession,” and she was admitting guilt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Even if [a] U.S. appeal is successful, the best outcome would be a re-trial where a new jury would have to consider the evidence again,” Amber continued.</p><p>“I simply cannot go through that for a third time [and] risk an impossible bill – one that is not just financial, but also psychological, physical and emotional,” the actress went on.</p><p>In April 2022, <a href=#>Amber was exposed on the stand for not donating</a> her entire divorce settlement from Johnny Depp, as she publicly declared she would in 2017.</p><p>ACLU, a non-profit that defends people’s rights and liberties, was supposed to get a portion of the divorce settlement. While they said they received $1.3 million from Amber, they hadn’t received the full $3.5 million promised.</p><p>The charity’s COO Terence Dougherty said on the stand that Amber claimed she was having “financial difficulties” when they attempted to collect the money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle’s Son Archie Spoiled By Lavish 4th Birthday Gift</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>CNN</a>, <a href=#>CNN</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW6wzqeYrZ2jYq6ursSrZKGdkaextHmQZqSipJyevK950p6rraSVorKvwIytpmabmJa%2FqsDYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./176362-fresh-prince-bel-air-spin-reportedly-wor-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Smith's Company Is Reportedly Working on a 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' Spin-Off</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-tiktok-universe-gift-worth-value-in-coins-and-real-money-what-does-it-mean.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is TikTok Universe Gift Worth?
