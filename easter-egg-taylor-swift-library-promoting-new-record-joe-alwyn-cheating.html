The pin most likely referenced the song "Florida!!!" from the upcoming album, which features a collaboration with Florence + The Machine, but the song is about cheating, and Taylor has said that she has been writing this album since before she and Joe broke up, so swifties are slowly trying to connect the dots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"All my girls got their lace and their crimes and your cheating husband disappeared / Well, no one asks any questions here / So I did my best, too lay to rest / All of the bodies that have ever been on my body and in my mind," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the lyrics read</a></strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Cheating rumors started long before this one theory</a>, though. After a particular mashup during an Eras tour concert featuring her songs "Getaway Car," "August," and "The Other Side of the Door", swifties took to social media to share their thoughts.</p><p>"So getaway car is from the perspective of the cheater, august is from the perspective of the other woman, and the other side of the door from the perspective of the woman who was cheated on," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a user wrote on X/Twitter</a> a little over a month ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swifties-are-sure-the-new-album-will-bash-joe-alwyn>Swifties Are Sure The New Album Will Bash Joe Alwyn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-1.jpg><p>Ever since Taylor Swift announced the name of her new album, fans have been convinced that it would be full of digs at Joe Alwyn. <strong>For starters, the name The Tortured Poests Department reminded fans of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">group chat Joe Alwyn had with Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott</a>, which was called the "Tortured Man Club."

Joe Alwyn is English, and Taylor had previously dedicated the song "London Boy" to him.</p><p>There are only a few hours to go until the release of the album, so doubts will be cleared out soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicmqukmr9uscagZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2htqO%2BwKuwZqiipLqwwMinnmamlax6s7HCqKmdZZqksm6ty7Cwp2WTnbKiwMinnmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grammys-2018-rita-oras-hair-how-to-secrets-steps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grammys 2018: Rita Oras Hair How-To, Secrets, Steps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-frank.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anne Frank</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
