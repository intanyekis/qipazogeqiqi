He was survived by his children and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Terri Irwin</strong></a>.</p><p>Although Bindi and Robert were only 8 and 2 at the time of their father’s passing, they’ve grown to <a href=#>carry on his legacy</a> in ways both big and small. Today, the family continues to run the Australia Zoo, which <a href=#>Steve’s parents started in the 1970s</a>.</p><p>Those who have come into the siblings’ life in the years since Steve’s death also love to pay tribute to the beloved zookeeper.</p><p>“Thank you for inspiring me and the whole world to love all wildlife,” Bindi’s husband, <a href=#><strong>Chandler Powell</strong></a>, captioned a photo of Steve with a crocodile to <a href=#>celebrate the late naturalist’s birthday</a> in February 2020. “You would be so proud of Bindi, Terri and Robert carrying on the amazing work you started. We will all make sure your message lives on for generations❤️🐊.”</p><p>During a September 2019 conversation with Us Weekly, Bindi and Chandler <a href=#>revealed their plan to honor Steve by incorporating khaki and animals into their wedding</a>.</p><p>“I really&nbsp;wanted Dad to be a big part of the day, so I’m excited to be able to incorporate him throughout the ceremony and the reception, and I think it’s going to be really special because I feel like his spirit lives on in us,” Bindi told Us at the time. “It’s going to be a celebration of family and friends, our wildlife, and I think that night, it’ll be about our lives together and the joining of families. It’s going to be beautiful.”</p><p>Terri noted that she was reminded of Steve often while <a href=#>wedding planning with her daughter</a> and Powell.</p><p>“I always think about what would Steve be doing, and while we’re discussing the wedding planning and the details, I know he would just be crying because he was so soft on the inside and loves [Bindi] and Robert so much and would have loved you, Chandler, and he would have definitely cried at the wedding. He couldn’t have given a speech. … It would have been incredibly special,” she told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>tied the knot at the Australia Zoo in March 2020</a>.
