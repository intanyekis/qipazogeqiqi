Also hosted by regular presenter Julie Chen, the ten-episode series is perhaps best remembered for <a href=#>the dramatic hush that fell on the house when she announced</a> that Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election.BBOTT - as it is often stylized - was different from the original Big Brother format in that there was a greater focus on live, unedited footage. The audience was also much more involved in the process than usual, as they were allowed to cast a vote towards who would be evicted.In total, 13 contestants took part in the show, with none of them having had any solid, prior claim to fame. More than half a decade later, this reality has not changed significantly for most of them, with a lot of their celebrity still only coming from their association with Big Brother. We take a look at where seven of these contestants are, and what they are doing with their lives today.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here Are The Richest 'Big Brother' Contestants</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-and-alex-willett-are-fashion-travel-and-fitness-enthusiasts><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Morgan And Alex Willett Are Fashion, Travel And Fitness Enthusiasts</span></h2><p>One of the interesting aspects of Big Brother: Over the Top was that it actually featured two sisters: Morgan and Alexandra 'Alex' Willett from Texas.
