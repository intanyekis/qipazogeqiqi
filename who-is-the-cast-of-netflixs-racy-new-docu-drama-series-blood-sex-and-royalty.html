As the woman who would partly lead to the split between the King and the Church, became a symbol of feminist ideals, and inspire various saucy rumors, Anne Boleyn has inspired a number of films, Broadway productions and TV shows <a href=#>including a mini-series with Jodie Turner-Smith in the titular role that was met with racist backlash</a>. There is even a chilling tale of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Boleyn's 'headless' ghost that haunts her place of birth</a>.Blood, Sex & Royalty combines historians' knowledge with steamy scripted drama, offering a glimpse into the lives of the Tudor monarchs and the noble house of Boleyn. The first season of Blood, Sex & Royalty only has three episodes, and there’s no telling if more will be added or if the series will get a second season. Though, if it is renewed by Netflix it is likely to be released in the fall of 2023.Blood, Sex & Royalty features two British soap opera stars as its leads; you might recognize them, as well as the other cast members.
