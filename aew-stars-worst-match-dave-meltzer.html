It lasted under 5 minutes with Bradshaw standing tall.</p><h2 id=mjf-vs-matt-cross-all-in-2018-2-75-stars><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>MJF: Vs Matt Cross, All In 2018 (2.75 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MJF-vs-Matt-Cross-All-In.jpg><p>MJF is still very young, but has had countless great matches already, though he hasn’t had a lot of matches rated just yet.

At Fastlane, he battled Bad News Barrett for the Intercontinental Championship.</p><p>The match itself was quite solid, but it ended with a truly frustrating disqualification finish which left fans both in the arena and at home groaning in despair.</p><h2 id=chris-jericho-vs-great-khali-raw-2010-0-stars><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Jericho: Vs Great Khali, Raw 2010 (0 Stars)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Great-Khali-vs-Chris-Jericho-WWE-Raw.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst there wasn’t anything overly wrong with this match, there was barely anything right either. Jericho targeted Khali’s leg until he found a chance to lock in the Walls of Jericho for quite a fast submission victory.</p><p>However, Khali is renowned for being one of the worst workers of all time, and his lack of selling ability might be why this match is rated so low.

Prior to the match, Rhodes (Goldust at the time) was injured, meaning that he couldn’t wrestle. He spent over 5 minutes stalling outside the ring, with Warrior doing some “comedy” spots such as smoking a cigar and trying to coax the Intercontinental Champion into the ring.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Claudio Castagnoli’s 10 Best Matches, According To Dave Meltzer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Rhodes got into the ring, he was sent back to the outside, before being counted out.

After being robbed of their spot on the show the year prior, the former Daniel Bryan and Sheamus had their chance to put on a great match for the World Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>However, it ended in 18 seconds with Sheamus hitting one move and winning, in what was a hugely shocking outcome.
