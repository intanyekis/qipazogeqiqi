The structure of the school was preserved, as were some of the rooms on the interior, however the rest of the one level school was restored and given all the special touches and comfortable furnishings that you'd expect from a home... along with a bunch of special perks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Post</a> indicates that the restored schoolhouse in Mount Morris spans across 14,000 square feet and sits on a massive 11 acre lot, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the owners have had it listed on the market</a> for well over 200 days now as they await the right buyer for this unique property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Harry Pays UK Taxpayers Back $3.1 Million Spent On Home Renovations</a></span></p><p>From the outside, this unsuspecting property looks exactly as you'd expect a school to appear, but the moment you walk in, it's apparent that you have just entered <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most unique restorations </a>you'll ever come across. The owner of this property, Crystal Smith, says that she and her husband have been living in the the residence since 2018, and they have quite appropriately named it The School House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home features four very large bedrooms, and four and a half bathrooms. Some of the features this property boasts are very well aligned with the building's historic roots. For example, like many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-million dollar mansions </a>that exist on today's market, this home features a massive indoor basketball court. The only difference here, is that this particular one actually existed as a gymnasium within the school.</p><p>One of the classrooms has been cleverly converted into an arcade, complete with all the incredible games a child's heart could possibly desire... and a few for the adults, too! With so many rooms to develop and design, Crystal and her husband renovated one into a home fitness center, complete with top-of-the-line equipment, and room to spare.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most stunning features to this school-turned-home that has sent TikTok into a frenzy, is the mammoth garage. The new buyers of this residence will be impressed if they have a car collection, as this home includes an impressive 30 car garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other adorable features include a cafeteria that's been converted into a huge kitchen, and of course, there's one particular room in the home that still has a massive whiteboard mounted onto the wall, sending school-vibes alongside the modern decor elements that have been added to the huge room.</p><p>Many viewers of the property have responded with complimentary commentary, but there are others are getting<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "creepy" vibes</a> from this experience. The school is located next to a cemetery, and is still up for grabs for the right buyer.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian Keeps $60 Million Mansion Following Divorce</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Pittsburgh</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaampGjsbC6xJ1kqZ2eo8C6uNWapaKZXaiwqbvOpWSmmZ6otrC6jK2gpKyfoHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-rocks-daughters-sell-girl-scout-cookies-408183.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Rock's Daughters Sold $65,000 Worth Of Girl Scout Cookies At The Oscars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dating-and-relationships.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Dove Cameron Dating Now?
