The incident, reported by the North Carolina Highway Patrol, ended with the unfortunate passing of Kevin Reed White, who was pronounced deceased at the scene. Trooper W.L. Silance shared that the vehicle, a 2012 Toyota Camry, left the road and collided with a mailbox before coming to a rest in a ditch in the 5200 block of Plain View Hwy.
