The mysterious disappearance case of Christina Whittaker has baffled the authorities for over a decade now.</p><p>Filmmaker Christina Fontana as she searches for the truth about what happened to Christina Whittaker, a young mother who vanished from the small town of Hannibal in Missouri, ‘Relentless’ is a Discovery and original true-crime series.&nbsp;</p><p>This cold case has puzzled the authorities for almost 12 years now, essentially because every time someone tries to review it, they only find conspiracies on betrayal, suicide, and murder. Thus, this six-part show delving deep into the complex quest for a missing person.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Christina Whittaker?</h2><p>At the age of 21, Christina Whittaker resided in the Oakwood neighborhood of Hannibal, Missouri, with her 6-month-old baby girl called Alexandria. According to her mother, she could act very child-like in her mentally ill state, suffering from depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, and bipolar disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Christina loved her family, so no one thought she’d ever leave any of them behind, at least not her daughter. As her psychiatric medication made her quite susceptive to manipulation, it’s also plausible that someone took sinful advantage of the young woman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Christina Whittaker?</h2><p>It is still unclear what happened to her on November 13, 2009. She went out with a few pals on November 13, 2009, to Rookie’s <a href=#>Sports</a> Bar at 600 Broadway. Later, they headed towards Sportsman at 611, where she drank a lot. Finally, she was asked to leave because her behavior during intoxication bothered other customers.</p><p>As a result, she left 15 minutes before midnight. She had asked many people for a ride home, but she was rejected. Thus, she walked away, apparently distressed. Since then, she hasn’t been seen or heard from.</p><p>The only evidence discovered by authorities after she was reported missing was her smartphone. Investigators found the phone near the 200 block of Seventh Street, just a few blocks away from where she was last seen alive.</p><p>Her boyfriend was initially seen as a person of interest, and he was the one who had contacted her for the last time. However, Christina’s sister, Cindy, claimed that he was with her family taking care of her infant at home that night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Progress of Christina Whittaker Disappearance Case</h2><p>Once Christina Whittaker was reported missing and the investigations into her disappearance commenced, the only piece of reliable evidence police recovered was her cellphone.</p><p>&nbsp;It was lying on the ground in the 200 block of Seventh Street, mere blocks from where she was last seen alive. As per reports, though, she’d planned to be home by midnight after stopping at a nearby restaurant to get her boyfriend, Travis Blackwell, something to eat. But alas, no other concrete trace of her has ever been discovered.</p><p>Tavis Blackwell seems to be crucial in the matter, though. He was one of the last people Christina called at about 10:30 p.m., but Travis also failed not one but two polygraph tests in early 2010, when he appeared on the ‘The Steve Wilkos Show.’&nbsp;</p><p>He’d gone on air to spread information about his girlfriend’s unexpected vanishing with Christina’s mother, Cindy Young, and other family members. But once the show’s polygraph expert asked if he had anything to do with the case, and he replied no, they indicated that he seemed nervous.</p><p>Soon after the episode aired, Cindy came out in Travis’ support, revealing that he’d been at their home, taking care of Christina’s daughter the entire night of November 13.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the one who notified Cindy that the young mother never returned home, and she waited until the next day, the 15th, to file a report. Moreover, Cindy explained that Christina’s then-boyfriend took a polygraph test after the show at the Hannibal Police Department and passed. Along with the rest of their family, she believes that he is innocent.</p><p>The other primary concern is Christina’s habits and tendency to take her prescription medicines irregularly, despite having been on them since 18-years-old.</p><p>It is also known that consuming liquor with bipolar pills can increase the risk of suicide and injury, turning individuals into impulsive and naïve beings. Plus, even Cindy has admitted that Christina had made suicidal statements in the past. However, there have been proclaimed sightings of Christina in Illinois, with law enforcement officials being unable to identify/catch her positively.</p><p>Christina had been apprehended for driving with a revoked license shortly before she vanished, so because she missed her December court date for the same, there is currently a warrant out for her arrest. Even with all that, though, there has been no hint of her for over a decade.&nbsp;</p><p>She is deemed in danger, and the lack of evidence means that officials have no choice but to examine every slight lead and tip that comes their way. They’ve not closed Christina’s case yet, and it seems like they don’t plan to do so until it is entirely and unquestionably solved.</p><p>The Hannibal Police Department has questioned over 200 people, worked with about 45 different agencies, including the FBI, and crossed out leads from coast to coast.&nbsp;</p><p>Christina or her remains have never been found, so it is a one-of-a-kind file within the HPD, especially with them still taking tips at (573)-221-0987 or online. As per the Help Find Christina Whittaker Facebook page, there is a $10,000 reward for information that may lead to closure. It is still unclear was it a disappearance, suicide, or murder?&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvx6ugrKyZo65uw8eiq62Zm5q%2FbrDIrJipqJWWv6K6wp5knJmjmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./delores-nowzaradan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ex-wife of Dr. Younan Nowzaradan &amp;amp; Her Net Worth 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./calahan-skogman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-536004-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Calahan Skogman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
