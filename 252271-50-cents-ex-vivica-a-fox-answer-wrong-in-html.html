Speaking on a piece of wrong advice she followed, Fox <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/vivica-a-fox-answers-25-wrong-questions-to-celebrate-lifetime-movie-milestone/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Listening to my girlfriend and taking a job that ruined my relationship with my boyfriend at the time."</p><p class=dh>When it came to questions on food, Fox revealed that the right kind of wrong when it came to dessert was chocolate souffle.
