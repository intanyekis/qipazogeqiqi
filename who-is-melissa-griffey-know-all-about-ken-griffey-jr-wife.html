Ken Griffey Sr., his baseball-playing father, accompanied him on his first flight. His father had already taken him up and let him fly a few times when he was 13-14 years old. In an interview, he stated that when he received his first single parcel of land, he first called his wife’s name, followed by his father’s.</p><p>He claimed that there was no danger of an aircraft disaster because learning about the Cirrus plane was straightforward for him and it contained a safety component such as a parachute. Ken recently purchased an auto-landing Cirrus Vision Jet. He said that by pressing a button, it would make contact with the tower, determine the winds, land at the airport, and come to a stop on the runway, allowing you to open the door.</p><h2><span id=Only_baseball_got_Kens_left_hand>Only baseball got Ken’s left hand</span></h2><p>Ken revealed that he is right-handed in an interview with The Pivot Podcast.
