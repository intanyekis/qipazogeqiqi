Authoritative sources estimate that Wynonna has managed to accumulate a net worth of over $20 million, virtually all of her wealth coming from her success as a country music singer during a career now spanning almost 40 years.</p><h3>Wynonna Judd Net Worth $20 Million</h3><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Wynonna’s birth name was that of her stepfather, whom her mother married after being deserted by Wynonna’s father before the girl was born. Naomi&nbsp;and now two girls and husband moved to Los Angeles in 1968, but she and the girls returned to Kentucky after&nbsp;Naomi’s divorce in 1972. Wynonna’s education revolved around music, and there was no holding her back after she acquired a guitar.</p><p>She and her mother moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1979 to try and break into the music industry, but it wasn’t until 1983 that they signed a deal with RCA Records, in collaboration with this record company, the duo subsequently released eleven albums selling over 20 million copies, and 26 singles of The Judds reached the top of the pops, by at least entering the charts.</p><p>In about eight years, they also won a myriad of country music awards, before&nbsp;Naomi had to retire, suffering from hepatitis E. The Judds ended their performances in 1991 but had been very successful and added large revenues to their respective net worths.</p><p>Although The Judds era ended, Wynonna embarked on a solo singing career, becoming known simply as Wynonna, working with RCA which proved a successful combination, as her net worth was further boosted with income from the sales of eight released albums, two compilation albums plus one live album.</p><p>As it was with The Judds, most of Wynonna`s singles entered the charts, too; her most popular singles are considered to be “I Saw the Light”, “To Be Loved By You”, “She Is His Only Need”, “My Strongest Weakness”, “Only Love”, and “No One Else on Earth”. A couple of Wynonna`s albums were certified as platinum also, thus undoubtedly helping Wynonna to increase her net worth.</p><p>Wynonna’s most recent album is entitled “Wynonna & the Big Noise”, released in 2016; her latest single is entitled “Something You Can`t Live Without” and was released in 2013, a precursor to the album.</p><p>Wynonna has also had many collaborations with other famous artists, not only with country music artists, but also with musicians of such music genres as jazz, rock, pop, gospel, and R&B, including performing alongside Clint Black,&nbsp;Kenny Rogers,&nbsp;Michael Bolton, Natalie Grant,&nbsp;Patti Labelle, and&nbsp;Dionne Warwick&nbsp;among many others. Wynonna contributed to&nbsp;Elvis Presley`s album “Elvis Presley&nbsp;Christmas Duets” in 2008, too, and has also performed and recorded intermittently with her mother over the last few years.</p><p>In addition to her singing career, it should not be forgotten that Wynonna has enlarged her net worth with income from acting and writing. As regards her career in TV acting, Wynonna voiced “The Magic School Bus”, and starred in “Touched by an Angel”, “Hope & Faith”, and “Wynonna: A Tribute on Ice”. She also hosted one of the seasons of Nashville Star, and as herself, Wynonna starred in “Army Wives” and “Kath & Kim”.</p><p>As for her personal life, Wynonna Judd married Arch Kelley in 1994, and they had a son and a daughter before divorcing in 1998. Wynonna was then married to D. R. Roach from 2003-2007 and later married Cactus Moser in 2012. They now live in Leipers Fork, Tennessee.</p><p>Finally, Wynonna Judd is also a philanthropist, in 2005 she was awarded the USO`s Merit Award for her contribution to the United States Armed Forces.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://popularbio.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://popularbio.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Music Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>What is Eija Skarsgard’s Net Worth?
