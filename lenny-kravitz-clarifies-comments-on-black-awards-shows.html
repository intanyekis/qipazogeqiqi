That is positive. And they don’t have anything to say about it? I have been that dream and example of what a Black artist can do. I’m not here for the accolades. I’m here for the experience.”</p><p>Kravitz, however, clarified in his statement that he only meant to call out Black <a href=#>awards shows</a> for not making more of an effort to include him.</p><p>“My comment was meant to express a concern about ensuring that Black artists are being recognized for their work in what is now being called ‘non-traditional’ Black music, which it is not,” he continued in Monday’s statement. “Rock and roll is the music we were instrumental in creating and is a part of our history. We must retain our heritage and celebrate that together.”</p><p>The singer concluded: “BET and countless others have paved the way for this type of recognition. I hope that by sharing my concern a spotlight will be shone on this issue. Love and peace.”</p><p>Kravitz is <a href=#>known for his unique sound</a>, which combines rock, funk, reggae, hard rock, soul and R&B. He won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance four years in a row from 1999 to 2002, breaking the record for <a href=#>most wins in that category</a> and setting the record for most consecutive wins in one category by a male performer.</p><p>The record producer has also been nominated for — and won — accolades including American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, Radio Music Awards and Brit Awards. Throughout his career, Kravitz has performed with iconic musicians including <strong>Mick Jagger, </strong>Aerosmith<strong>, Led Zeppelin, Stevie Wonder, </strong>Michael Jackson<strong> and Jay-Z</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to making his mark in the music world, Kravitz has ventured into acting with roles in TV shows such as Entourage, Better Things and Star. On the big screen, Kravitz won over audiences with <a href=#>his portrayal of Cinna in The Hunger Games </a>film franchise. He has also appeared in movies including Precious, The Butler and Shotgun Wedding.</p><p>During his interview with Esquire, Kravitz reflected on his career and explained why he had no plans to take a break from music, saying, “But what is that? You know what I mean? What drives me is the creative.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOepp6ueqy%2BwK%2BgrbJdmLmivsifoJ6rXZi8rrnEp6usZZ%2BjeqO4wJyiZpmnlr%2Blv4ysn6ivo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-plastic-surgery-lipstick-alley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lipstick Alley and Reddit Discussions!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-hawk-wiki-wife-married-net-worth-age-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Hawk Wiki, Wife, Children, Net worth, Family, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
