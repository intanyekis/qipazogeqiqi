The sophisticated, yet relatable, name dates back to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Twining Family</a>, who moved to London in 1684. Through the centuries, it has been a choice for aristocrats, working people, and tourists to Epcot. You'd be hard-pressed to find a tea-lover who hasn't steeped a cup of Twining.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>High Tea In London: 10 Poshest Locations</a></span></p><p>The second place tea was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhuyeqing&nbsp;Tea</a>. Perhaps less familiar to many drinkers in the West, this tea is mostly made from the mountainside of Mount Emei. It is there, under the correct conditions, that the average temperature during the year is most suitable for the growth of Zhuyeqing tea. This Chinese selection is one that many hold near and dear to their hearts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rounding out the top three is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TWG Tea from Singapore</a>. While third on the list, it's growth is the most amazing of the bunch as it only launched in 2008 with a branding strategy focused on providing <a href=#>a high-quality&nbsp;experienc</a>e to a global marketplace. After a little over a decade in existence, it has quickly become one of the most sought after and beloved brands in the world.</p><p>The Top Ten finishes off with Harney & Sons at number four, Dilmah at number five, and the rest of the list featuring Tetley, Mariage Frères, Chaitime, Tazo, and Itokyuemon, in that order.</p><p>Global tea production releases about 6.15 million tons of tea every year, through over 5,000 different brands around the world. The list on World Brand Lab was developed with the worldwide consumer in mind and based on three core indicators—brand strength, consumer value-added index, and the enterprise development index.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>World Brand Lab&nbsp;held a massive&nbsp;screening of more than 5,000 tea brands, before selecting 300 "super brands". That list came from 20 countries known for having mature tea industries. That super list was then analyzed and ranked to give us the top ten we have today.</p><p>Michael Rice, a member of the World Brand Lab expert panel expressed his love of the beverage and, though his own words, shows why tea-lovers from across the world all take stock in the latest rankings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The benefits of drinking tea have long been understood by the Chinese people and extend far beyond the effects of caffeine for which it is best known in the West. From digestive health—including weight loss—to the enhancement of the circulatory system, the treatment of diabetes, and the improvement of memory, a daily tea-drinking regimen can improve your life and increase your enjoyment of it."</p><p>That explanation of why the drink is so beloved isn't news to many. For those inspired by reading this, and now heading to brew a cup right now, no explanation is needed anyway.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>8 Teas from Around The World With Superpowers</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PR Newswire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twinings</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhuyeqing Tea</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TWG Tea</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9Oop2akpa3Cs8WMrZyaq11nfXN9jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-shane-van-gisbergen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Shane Van Gisbergen As He Got A Set Back In His Recent Endeavour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./julia-louis-dreyfus-brings-son-charlie-hall-to-state-dinner-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Julia Louis-Dreyfus Brings Son Charlie Hall to State Dinner: Pics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
