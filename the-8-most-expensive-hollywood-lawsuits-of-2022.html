Is it <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">extortion</a> of highly paid celebrities or simply others wanting to get justice over a situation they deem unfair?</p><p>Check out the Hollywood lawsuits of 2022.</p><h2 id=travis-scott-vs-shanazia-williamson>Travis Scott vs. Shanazia Williamson</h2><p>In 2021, the rapper performed at the Astroworld Festival in Houston TX and the unthinkable occurred. As fans began to surge toward the stage, the struggle to get close to Scott ended in the death of 10 lives. Unbelievably, Scott continued to perform, unaware of what was happening in the crowd and in early 2022, a report was issued claiming 5,000 fans suffered various injuries at the event. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Several lawsuits have been filed</a> against Scott and Live Nation and in May, Shanazia Williamson filed a wrongful death suit against Scott for her miscarriage after being injured at Astroworld. Scott has yet to see his day in court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=irving-azoff-vs-gloria-martinez>Irving Azoff vs. Gloria Martinez</h2><p>The music executive has managed the likes of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Christiana Aguilera</a>, The Eagles and Bon Jovi but right now, he’s being sued by his former housekeeper for unpaid wages and discrimination. Over more than 10 years with Azoff and his wife, Martinez claims she was supposed to be paid $1,500 per week, however, the pay varied from week to week. The Azoff’s claim Martinez was taking unauthorized time off and not fulfilling her duties.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-vs-angelina-jolie>Brad Pitt vs. Angelina Jolie</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Six years after the dramatic details unfolded regarding the divorce of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Pitt</a> and Jolie, they are still fighting in court regarding assets, interest and money. In Feb. Pitt filed an accusation for breach of contract against Jolie when she sold 50 percent of ownership stake in the couple’s shared French vineyard, Chateau Miraval. Pitt said the couple agreed to not sell their share without consent from both parties and he wants to protect his investment. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, Jolie came out victorious on the vineyard case but rest assured, there will be more to come.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie Sues Brad Pitt For $250 Million Due to Winery</a></span></p><h2 id=wendy-williams-vs-wells-fargo>Wendy Williams vs. Wells Fargo</h2><p>The previous talk show host has had physical and mental health issues over the years which eventually landed her in a legal battle with her bank. Williams claimed the bank <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">blocked her from access to millions of dollars </a>belonging to her and according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Wells Fargo believes she is and was being exploited. The court case is still ongoing, but hopefully Williams will have the opportunity to return to the “Wendy Williams Show” and her financial woe’s will come to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-vs-sami-chokri>Ed Sheeran vs. Sami Chokri</h2><p>The “Shape of You” singer was accused of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">copyright</a> infringement by the artist who performs under stage name ‘Sami Switch’. He claimed a lyric in his song “Oh Why” was similar to Sheeran’s hit song. In April of 2022, a judge ruled in Sheeran’s favor and he took the opportunity to talk about bogus claims and the all-too regular practice of settling them out of court, prompting more people to attempt similar lawsuits.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-vs-amber-heard>Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this summer, the court battle that kept everyone glued to their screens was that of double defamation lawsuits against the divorced couple. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Depp sued Heard over a 2018 op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post, in which she claimed to be representing a public figure suffering from domestic abuse. Heard in turn, sued Depp for statements his attorney made about her. Both won their <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">defamation suits,</a> though Depp was awarded $15 million and Heard was awarded $2 million.</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-vs-family-of-halyna-hutchins>Alec Baldwin vs. family of Halyna Hutchins</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late 2021, tragedy struck when Baldwin intended to use a prop gun to demonstrate a shooting scene on the set of his movie Rust, and for reasons still unclear, a real bullet was fired, killing cinematographer, Hutchins and injuring Director Joel Souza. The <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">wrongful death suit </a>is just one of numerous lawsuits filed against Baldwin, including that of chief of lighting crew member Serge Svetnoy and script supervisor Mamie Mitchell.</p><h2 id=ricky-martin-vs-dennis-yadiel-sanchez>Ricky Martin vs. Dennis Yadiel Sanchez</h2><p>In Sept. f<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">amous singer Ricky Martin</a> filed a $20 million lawsuit against his nephew, Sanchez after the 21-year-old accused him of sexual abuse. According to Martin, the drama was a result of his “maladjusted” nephew threatening to ruin his reputation if he didn’t share his bank account. When Sanchez’ claims came out earlier this year, the rumors were swirling but after a brief silence by the Martin camp, he was able to proclaim his innocence and file suit for loss of work, fear for his family and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp Will “Absolutely” Return To Pirates Of The Caribbean</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">People</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMcWSmp6OpeqbEz56lrKGmmnqpu8ulsLCnn5l6ra3WrKyirKNivKd5kWlpa2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-najarian-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Najarian Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-ealy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Ealy Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
