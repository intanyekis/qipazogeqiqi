Dil Raju, during an interview, said,<br><strong>Ajith sir’s film will be released alongside mine in Tamil Nadu. It is well known that Vijay sir is Tamil Nadu’s number one star. As a result, his film (Varisu) deserves to be seen on more screens than Thunivu. The state has 800 screens in total.” He further stated “Both films are currently getting an equal number of screens. Because Vijay sir is a bigger star than Ajith, I’m literally begging for at least 50 more screens for my film."</strong><br>The comment didn't go well with the fans of Vijay and Ajith and they started criticizing Raju for his negative remark. Taking to Twitter, the netizens slammed Raju and called him out for being disrespectful. Later, in an interview, Raju issued a clarification regarding the same and said that his words were taken out of context. Further, Raju explained that during the interview, he discussed several positive aspects of both the Tamil actor (Vijay and Ajith); however, a single statement destroyed the entire interview.<br><strong>• Copyright case against Dil Raju</strong><br>In 2017, a case was registered against Dil Raju with the Hyderabad police under the copyright act. Reportedly, the case was filed after a writer, Shyamala Rani, filed a petition at the Miyapur court, accusing Raju's film Mr Perfect's (2011) storyline was copied from her novel that was published in 2010. According to sources, Shymala Rani alleged that the central theme of Mr Perfect (2017) was taken from the Tamil-language novel Na Manasu Korindi Ninne without her consent, which amounted to cheating. In an interview, a police official of Madhavpur Police station, Hyderabad, discussed the case and said,<br><strong>The complaint has been lodged on the name of Dil Raju aka Venkataramana Reddy under sections 120A, 415, 420 of the Copyright Act 63 under the IPC. Even director Dasaradh has has been named in the case.”</strong><br><strong>• Dil Raju accused of blocking theatres</strong><br>Warangal Sinu, a film distributor, accused Dil Raju of blocking movie theatres in Hyderabad. Reportedly, in 2021, Raju replaced Sinu's film Krack (2021) with his film Master (2021). In an interview, Warangal Sinu talked about the same and explained that Raju owns multiple movie theatres in Hyderabad, due to which he is often alleged by producers of the Tamil film industry of blocking theatres for the release of films under his banner. During the same discussion, Sinu said that 'He is not Dil Raju, but Kill Raju' because he frequently conspires to kill the revenue of people who are not associated with his banner in the Tamil film industry. Sinu said,<br><strong>He is not Dil Raju anymore, but 'Kill' Raju -- killing the revenue of movies he doesn't own. The same producer had stated that dubbed movies cannot get a huge release in the Nizam area during festivals. Now, as he shares the revenue for Master, he has turned the situation in his own favour."</strong></td><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGiboqRdp66rwY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eren-kartal-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-642596-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eren Kartal Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-matthew-mcconaughey-and-jennifer-lopez-get-along-while-filming-the-wedding-planner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Matthew McConaughey And Jennifer Lopez Get Along While Filming The Wedding Planner?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
