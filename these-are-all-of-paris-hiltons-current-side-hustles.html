Now, the heiress is so much more than the symbol of decadence and privilege that she was all those years ago.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Paris Hilton And Tom Cruise?</a></span>Paris was lampooned routinely for her famous line "That's hot!" and for many other things, like her sex tape and her weird Carl's Jr commercials. Today, Hilton has several ventures that include philanthropy, activism, and numerous side hustles and projects. Here is what the <a href=#>$300 million heiress </a>has been working on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-cashing-in-on-nfts><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paris Hilton Is Cashing In On NFTs</span></h2><p>Paris Hilton got in on the crypto game before the 2022 Bitcoin crash by cashing in on the NFT (non-fungible token) market. While some argue that NFTs are complicated, confusing, and are involved in a high-risk volatile market, Hilton has used the capital at her disposal to make a healthy profit buying, selling, and distributing NFTs. And she shared the love with fans. When she did an interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, <a href=#>she gave each member of the audience their own NFT</a>.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-now-an-activist><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Paris Hilton Is Now An Activist</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many who criticize Paris Hilton argue that she had it easy growing up thanks to her money and privilege. While it is true she grew up better off than most people financially, it was not all easy for her. <a href=#>Paris is an abuse survivor</a>, and she endured this abuse at the hands of underregulated reform schools. When the Utah legislature was considering a bill to change how these schools operate, Hilton lobbied for the bill to pass and testified before the legislature. She also did a press conference where she revealed the story of her pain to the world. No one knew when they were watching The Simple Life all those years ago that Paris had endured so much trauma. She has also done a lot of work to gather donations for children's hospitals and the Make-A-Wish foundation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Danny Devito Is A Major Political Activist, And He's Far From The Only One In Hollywood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-started-djing-in-2016><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Paris Hilton Started DJing In 2016</span></h2><p>Although she took short break after 2019, especially after the COVID pandemic put a damper on large gatherings, Hilton has otherwise been making the rounds at clubs and festivals as a DJ since 2016. Photos and clips of her spinning tracks to a bouncing crowd of partiers can be found all over the internet. Her DJ experience would come in handy during the COVID pandemic, as in 2020 she organized a virtual music festival called #Trillerfest, to raise money for hungry children. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A portion of the profits also went to frontline workers</a> who weathered the worst of the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-doing-very-well-on-social-media><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Paris Hilton Is Doing Very Well On Social Media</span></h2><p>Like her friend Kim Kardashian and many other socialites, Paris Hilton is highly active on social media. She has 20 million followers on Instagram, 17 million on Twitter, and 6.5 million on TikTok. She is also rather savvy with the apps, especially TikTok. Having a strong TikTok presence is important for celebrities to maintain a connection with younger audiences, especially as the app grows in popularity. Hilton uses the app not only for selfies or stories, the way most use the app, but also to highlight her current projects like her NFT enterprise.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-returned-to-television-with-mixed-results><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Paris Hilton Returned To Television, With Mixed Results</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris made her return to reality television in recent years after several years on hiatus. She came back into the spotlight with Paris In Love which followed her engagement and marriage to her husband Carter Reum. She also starred in an offbeat cooking show, Cooking With Paris, on Netflix. The cooking show premiered in 2021 but was canceled in 2022 due to low viewership. Some critics argue that she <a href=#>did not need to come back</a> to reality television at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Ridiculous Reason Why Paris Hilton's Wedding Guests Were 'Very, Very Upset'</a></span></p><h2 id=paris-hilton-produced-multiple-documentaries><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paris Hilton Produced Multiple Documentaries</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paris acted as either producer or executive producer for all of the above-mentioned projects. She also produces documentaries now. In 2018 she produced The American Meme, a documentary that chronicled the drama that followed her and others as they become famous online. She also produced This Is Paris, a 2020 documentary that told the story of her life, and revealed to the world the side of Paris they had never seen before. She spoke candidly about her trauma growing up, how she put on the ruse of her "dumb blonde" character for her early reality shows, and opened up about how being constantly lampooned affected her.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-still-modeling><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paris Hilton Is Still Modeling</span></h2><p>For those wondering, no, Paris Hilton has not given up modeling. She still struts the runway from time to time, and she did so in 2020 for her friend Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie show in Paris. She also models for her own brand and its products regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-is-heavily-involved-in-the-fashion-industry><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paris Hilton Is Heavily Involved In The Fashion Industry</span></h2><p>Paris Hilton has created an entire brand under her name and has become her own spokesperson for several fashion and boutique-related products. Everything from clothes to perfumes bear the Paris Hilton brand, she has even branched into colognes and scents for men. As one can see, the hotel heiress has been keeping herself very busy the last couple of years.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#>Here's What Kim Kardashian Does To Stay In Top-Notch Shape And Look Ageless At 41</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmmKWkXaSzbrzAq6CsZZieubW7zaxknK2ip7KvwIysoJ2dXZ3CtMDLnqpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./naya-rivera-ring-engaged-big-sean-184472.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Could This Be The Engagement Ring Big Sean Gifted Naya Rivera?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-acne-serums.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Acne Serums for Whiteheads, Blackheads, Clogged Pores and Cystic Acne</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
