They were with separate groups of friends, but they met, and decided to go ahead to another nightclub together. After that night in 1967, McCartney would go on to marry Eastman, and together they had three children. As far as Beatles children go, McCartney's children are&nbsp;very successful, just like their dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCartney married Eastman in 1969, just as <a href=#>his band The Beatles, one of the biggest bands in the world</a> (and they still are), were breaking up and going their separate ways and entering into solo careers. Before they had children of their own, McCartney adopted Eastman's daughter Heather, whom she had from her previous marriage. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UltimateClassicRock.com</a>, Heather gained the famous McCartney name and went on to become a notable photographer like her mother and a potter, which lead her to start a line of houseware items in 1999.</p><p>When the couple wed in 1969, they were already expecting their first child, Mary, who was named after McCartney's mother. Mary is the baby under McCartney's coat in the picture on the back cover of McCartney's self-titled first solo album, and the picture was taken by Eastman herself. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Times</a>, Mary decided, most likely after seeing her mother's famous photography work, that she wanted to become a photographer as well, and phoned her mother about it. Her mother instantly gave her a&nbsp;Leica R, and ever since Mary has never stopped taking pictures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney At 77 Years Old: A Timeline Of Everything He's Accomplished (So Far)</a></span></p><p>Mary went on to become a renowned photographer. She was a photo editor at the music-book publisher Omnibus Press, and her first photography exhibit was called&nbsp;<i>Off Pointe: A Photographic Study of The Royal Ballet After Hours.&nbsp;</i>In 2001, she produced a documentary called Wingspan, about her father and Eastman's band Wings. She also runs the photo department of McCartney's company MPL Communications. Mary is also a firm charity worker, as she has had campaigns for breast cancer (which Eastman died of in 1998), and took photos for The Constellation Smile project.</p><p>She, like her father, is a firm vegetarian, and co-founder of Meat Free Monday and an ambassador of Green Monday, a non-profit organization that supports mean-free living. She has also produced two vegetarian cookbooks. Outside her work she has four children from two separate marriages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney's Handwritten Hey Jude Lyrics Sold For $910,000&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>In 1971, just before the McCartneys started Wings, they had their second daughter Stella, and if you've ever watched any red carpets, who'll recognize her name as one of the most famous fashion designers in recent years. Stella and Mary spent much of their childhood on the road with their parents on Wings tours around the world, but from an early age, Stella wanted to be a designer. From the age of 13, she started making her own clothes and continued on with it in school, going on to shadow&nbsp;Savile Row tailor Edward Sexton after she graduated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her designs are known for their simple feminine touch and have a wearable design. "It's not about what it looks like in the studio or on the runway," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a>. "It's what it looks like on a real person that matters. That isn't easy, but it's what's fun." In 2001, she launched her fashion house, and now has 51 freestanding stores all over the world. She has a perfume line, as well as lingerie, children's, and men's lines as well. She's had loads of collaborations over the years including one with Adidas, Disneym and even Taylor Swift. In 2010, she was chosen as Team GB's Creative Director for the 2012 Olympics by Adidas and designed the entire countries team outfits.</p><p>Like her older sister, she too is a firm vegetarian and doesn't use any leather or fur in her designs. She also formed a breast cancer charity called Stella McCartney Cares Foundation. She has designed for Meghan Markle and other high profile celebrities, and is married to British publisher Alasdhair Willis and they have four children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Stella, the McCartneys had their son James, named after McCartney's real name. James found an interest in music from an early age, but it wasn't because of his rock star dad. According to UltimateClassicRock.com, James&nbsp;actually&nbsp;wanted to become a musician after he saw Marty McFly play guitar in Back to the Future. He was given a Fender Stratocaster that was once owned by Carl Perkins by his father, and went on to play guitar and drums on his fathers albums like Flaming Pie and Driving Rain. The EP, Available Light was his first solo release, his&nbsp;<i>The Complete EP Collection&nbsp;</i>was released in 2012, and his first album, Me, was released in 2013. His newest album is&nbsp;<i>The Blackberry Train,</i>&nbsp;which was<i>&nbsp;</i>released in 2016. He is also a practicing vegetarian like the rest of his family.</p><p>The famous Beatles' youngest child is Beatrice, whom he had with his second wife, Heather Mills, in 2003. Following her parents' controversial divorce, she currently lives with both of them. She was the flower girl at her father's wedding to his third wife Nancy Shevell, but her parents have largely kept her out of the spotlight, and she lives a private life. She is now sixteen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It goes without saying that McCartney's children have done well and made names for themselves. It's also really sweet that two of the children have followed in the footsteps of their parents, and still support great charities. McCartney loves his family and is constantly collaborating with them and supporting them.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Lennon And Yoko Ono: Everything We Remember About The Complicated Affair</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKmZpaF6rq%2FCmqmtppWuwG6vx6KjnaqVo3qivsRmm6ihnpx6r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./last-songs-nicholas-sparks-on-miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworths-wedding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Last Songs Nicholas Sparks on Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth's Wedding</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-ashley-bio-wiki-age-height-family-married-salary-net-worth-and-abc7.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Ashley Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Married, Salary, Net Worth and ABC7</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
