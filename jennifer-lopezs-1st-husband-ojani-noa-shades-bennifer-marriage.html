Ben is husband No. 4,” he told the outlet. “I was husband No. 1 and she told me I was the love of her life. When we lay in bed on our wedding night, she said we would be together forever.”</p><p>The Cuba native continued to confess his heartbreak about their divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Jennifer-Lopezs-1st-Husband-Ojani-Noa-Says-He-Is-%E2%80%98Not-Convinced-Her-Marriage-to-Ben-Affleck-%E2%80%98Will-Last.jpg><p>“We fell in love when she was already famous. But during our marriage she became a megastar,” he recalled. “For years it was too painful to talk about. I wanted to lie low and live my life. But when I saw she got married to Ben, who is a good guy, the feelings came flooding back.”</p><p>For all Noa’s devastation, Lopez — who was married to the producer from February 1997 to January 1998 — previously told <a href=#>Today</a> in 2019 that their marriage didn’t “really count” in her mind.</p><p>“I’ve been married three times. And once was nine months, and once was 11 months,” the “Jenny From the Block” singer revealed at the time, recalling her marriages to <a href=#><strong>Cris Judd</strong></a> and Noa. The Enough star and her backup dancer, now 52, tied the knot in September 2001. She filed for divorce in July 2002.</p><p>“I was very young the first two times I tried to get married. I would say try to get married,” Lopez added, noting that she was “so young” at the time. “I felt like if I got married I felt like I would always have somebody, but that’s not how life works.”</p><p>The Maid in Manhattan actress did, however, “count” her 10-year marriage to <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>, with whom she shares 14-year-old twins Max and Emme.</p><p>Throughout her career in the spotlight, the “On the Floor” artist has been engaged to Affleck, 49, twice, as well as Noa, Judd, Anthony and <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a> — whom she split from in April 2021, one month before she reconnected with her new husband.</p><p>For his part, the Good Will Hunting star — whose <a href=#>past high-profile romances</a> include <a href=#><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ana de Armas</strong></a> — was married to <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong> </a>for 13 years. Affleck and the Juno star, 50, share daughters Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13, and son Samuel, 10.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After <a href=#>proposing to Lopez twice</a> — first in November 2002, and again, nearly two decades later, in April — Affleck finally married the “I’m Real” singer.</p><p>“We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,” Lopez <a href=#>wrote in her official “On the JLo” newsletter</a> on July 17, one day after their wedding in Las Vegas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr8BufdKtZKGto5eur7CMqKGappliu7CtjKyfmpyVqHqjsc2noJ%2BdomK6or7RopignV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-son-aires-sneakers-rival-her-1-million-shoe-collection.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Shows Off Son Aire's Sneakers That Rival Her $1 Million Shoe Collection</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-rich-was-gwen-shamblin-and-who-got-her-money-566020-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How rich was Gwen Shamblin and who got her money?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
