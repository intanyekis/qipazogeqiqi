In her series of interviews this week, Swift confirmed that she wrote an extended version of the song during rehearsals in 2011, during the Speak Now tour, a few months after their reported split in late 2010. Although fans never had the opportunity to listen to the original track before, Swift decided to include it in Red (Taylor's Version), so they could listen to it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Fans Would Rather Talk About The Video Than Congratulate Blake Lively's Directorial Debut</a></span></p><h2 id=deux-discussions-user-says-it-was-anne-hathaway>Deux.Discussions User Says It Was Anne Hathaway</h2><p>In the song, Taylor touches upon the aftermath of her relationship ending and being consoled by an actress when she was crying in a bathroom. In All Too Well (10 Minute Version), Taylor sings, "Not weeping in a party bathroom / Some actress asking me what happened, you / That's what happened, you."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Previously, fans believed that the song referred to Jennifer Aniston, who, as per Daily News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">consoled Swift at a 2011 event, telling her to "hang in there."</a></p><p>An insider has revealed to Instagram celebrity gossip account DeuxMoi, that it wasn't Aniston but <a href=#>The Princess Diaries star Anne Hathaway</a> who comforted Taylor Swift.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Social Media Continues To Celebrate 'The Princess Diaries' Following Anne Hathaway’s Recent Instagram Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source shared: "I have it on VERY VERY good authority that the All Too Well actress is Anne Hathaway (as has been speculated elsewhere, but you can consider it confirmed)."</p><p>They further revealed that Hathaway and Gyllenhaal were "friendly" while filming Love & Other Drugs, but she was aware of his dating reputation.</p><p>"Anne and Jake were friendly enough while filming Love & Other Drugs, but she also was aware about how much a Fboy he could be and when they had to start doing press for the film and its release, it was just as T & J were at their peak/messiest.
