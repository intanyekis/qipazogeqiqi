López Cantinflas Wiki Biography</h2><p>Cantinflas was born Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno-Reyes on the 12th August 1911, in Cotija de la Paz Michoacan, Mexico, and was a comic film actor, producer, and screenwriter, one of the icons of the Latin American and Mexican entertainment industry. Cantiflas was best known for his roles in such movies as “Around the World in Eighty Days” (1956), for which he received a Golden Globe, “Pepe” (1960), “Su Excelencia” (1967), and “El Barrendero” (1982). His career started in 1937 and ended in 1982. He passed away in April 1993 in Mexico City.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Cantiflas was, at the time of his death? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Cantiflas’ net worth was as high as $5 million, earned through his successful acting career. In addition to being among the famous Latin-American actors, Cantiflas also worked as a producer and screenwriter, which also improved his wealth.</p><h3>Cantiflas Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Cantinflas was born one of eight children of María de la Soledad Reyes Guízar, and Pedro Moreno Esquivel, a poor mail carrier. He grew up in the tough Mexico City neighborhood of Tepito, and thanks to his wit and street smarts, Cantiflas made it to the circus tent shows at first, and later to theatre and cinema.</p><p>Before pursuing a career in entertainment, Cantiflas explored various possible careers such as professional boxing and medicine. By 1930, he joined the Mexican carpa, a travelling tent in which he worked as a dancer and acrobat, performing various roles. A few years later, he met the publicist and producer Santiago Reachi, who played a key role in Cantiflas’ early career, securing him parts in his productions.<br>Cantiflas made his debut in “Don’t Fool Yourself Dear” (1937), and later starred in “Such Is My Country” (1937). He then appeared in “Águila o Sol” (1938), “The Sign of Death” (1939), “You’re Missing the Point” (1940), “Neither Blood Nor Sand” (1941), and “El Gendarme Desconocido” (1942), which not only increased his net worth, but also his popularity. Cantiflas continued with “El circo” (1943), “Romeo y Julieta” (1943), “Gran Hotel” (1944), and “One Day with the Devil”. (1945). He ended the decade with “Soy un Prófugo” (1946), “¡A Volar Joven!” (1947), “El Supersabio” (1948), “El Mago” (1949), and “El Porter” (1949). Thanks to his massive popularity in the ‘40s, Cantiflas’ net worth significantly increased.</p><p>In the ‘50s, Cantiflas played in “El siete machos” (1951), “Si yo fuera diputado” (1952), “El bombero atómico” (1953), “Mr. Photographer” (1953), “Caballero a la medida” (1954), and “Drop the Curtain” (1955). In 1956, he made his Hollywood debut in the Oscar-winning comedy “Around the World in Eighty Days” starring David Niven, and Finlay Currie, winning a Golden Globe award for his role as Passepartout. By the end of the ‘50s, Cantiflas had starred in “Raquel’s Shoeshiner” (1957), “Housewife to Your Neighbor” (1958), and “Sube y baja” (1959). He continued filming in the ‘60s and ‘70s, but his career slowed down. However, he had notable roles in such movies as the Oscar-nominated comedy-musical “Pepe” (1960), “The Illiterate One” (1961), “The Little Priest” (1964), “Su Excelencia” (1967), “El Ministro y yo” (1976), and “El Patrullero 777” (1978). His last role was in the TV series “Horror Kung-Fu Theatre” where he played an impersonator.</p><p>Cantiflas was a pioneer of the Mexican cinema, and his legacy is enormous. He was also a political conservative and spoke against charrismo, the one-party government’s practice of co-opting and controlling unions.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Cantiflas was married to Valentina Ivanova Zubareff from 1936 to her death in 1966. He had a son with another woman, but Valentina adopted the boy and named him Mario Arturo Moreno Ivanova. Cantiflas died of lung cancer in April 1993, after being a lifelong smoker. Thousands of people appeared at his funeral, while the legal battle began between his “adopted” son and nephew Eduardo Moreno Laparade over the control of 34 Cantinflas’ movies.</p><p>Cantiflas was known as the national folk hero thanks to his philanthropic work and humanitarian organisations; he often contributed to the Roman Catholic Church and orphanages.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 12, 1911</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1993-04-20</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa María La Ribera, Mexico City, Mexico</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.73 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Comedian</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Mexican</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Valentina Ivanova Zuvareff (m. 1936–1966)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Mario Arturo Moreno Ivanova</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Pedro Moreno Esquivel, María de la Soledad Reyes Guízar</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Rafael Moreno Reyes, Roberto Moreno Reyes, Julio Moreno Reyes, José “Pepe” Moreno Reyes, Eduardo Moreno Reyes, Esperanza Moreno Reyes, Pedro Moreno Reyes, Gabriel Moreno Reyes</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0134594/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cantinflas-mn0001250086</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=writer><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Gli addii</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Movie story</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Uncle Martino</td><td>1960</td><td>TV Movie play</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BBC Sunday-Night Theatre</td><td>1952</td><td>TV Series writer – 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Streets of Sorrow</td><td>1950</td><td>play</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>L’usuraio</td><td>1943</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mater dolorosa</td><td>1943</td><td>adaptation / screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Genius and the Nightingale</td><td>1943</td><td>adaptation</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>La signorina</td><td>1942</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Two Orphans</td><td>1942</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>I sette peccati</td><td>1942</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Broken Love</td><td>1942</td><td>screenplay / story</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Turbamento</td><td>1942</td><td>play / screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mamma</td><td>1941</td><td>dialogue / screenplay / story</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>L’uomo del romanzo</td><td>1940</td><td>play / screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Yó soy mi rival</td><td>1940</td><td>play / screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Eternal Melodies</td><td>1940</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Musica di sogno</td><td>1940</td><td>refilmed scenes and dubbing dialogue</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Amami, Alfredo!</td><td>1940</td><td>screenplay / story</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Passione</td><td>1940</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Antonio Meucci</td><td>1940</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Manon Lescaut</td><td>1940</td><td>adaptation / screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Dream of Butterfly</td><td>1939</td><td>dialogue</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Le père Lebonnard</td><td>1939</td><td>screenplay – uncredited</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>E tornato Carnevale</td><td>1937</td><td>play “È tornato carnevale”</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lady of Paradise</td><td>1937</td><td>play</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Wedding March</td><td>1936</td><td>screenplay</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>La scala di seta</td><td>1920</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>La trentesima perla</td><td>1920</td><td>play</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiamqaknrunuMCsZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-koppel.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Andrea Koppel Share Any Kids With Husband, Kenneth M.
