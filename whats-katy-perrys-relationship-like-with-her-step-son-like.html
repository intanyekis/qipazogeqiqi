The TikTok featured clips of Miranda embracing Katy on the MET Gala red carpet, with the following audio playing over, “<a href=#>Me? Obsessed with you? Yes, yes I am</a>.” “When you love your son’s stepmom,” Miranda captioned the post.</p><p>Even as early as 2017, Miranda said her son got on well with Orlando’s new girlfriend. “<a href=#>Yeah, they’re great</a>,” Miranda told Vogue UK. “They get along really well.”</p><p>Katy has also gushed over Miranda.

This is because Katy and Orlando have yet to legally tie the knot.</p><p>The couple have reportedly postponed their wedding plans on multiple occasions. They first pushed the date in 2019 after they couldn’t secure their dream location.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They changed the timing due to the location they want,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. “They’re beyond in love.”</p><p>However, the following year they had to postpone it again in light of the coronavirus pandemic. “<a href=#>It was all set for Japan with 150 guests</a>. Katy was actually really excited about walking down the aisle pregnant,” a source told PEOPLE in 2020.</p><p>“They were both so elated that all the wedding details were finally coming together, but they are hitting pause because of coronavirus,” they continued.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Katy Perry Quitting Music?</a></span></p><p>Katy announced her pregnancy the same year, only to give birth to a daughter in 2021.
