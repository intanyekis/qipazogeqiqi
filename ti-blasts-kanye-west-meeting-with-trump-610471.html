The rap veteran shared a portion of Kanye and Trump’s sitdown while sharing his disgust over his friend’s behavior.</p><p>“This sh*t is next level, futuristic Sambo, Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django a** shit Ye,” he said. “From what I can gather, this is the most repulsive, disgraceful, an embarrassing act of desperation and auctioning off of one’s soul to gain power I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>T.I. also revealed how he rejected Kanye’s invite to attend the White House meeting but wishes he went so he could’ve smacked some sense into him.</p><p>“If you behaved that spinelessly in my presence, I feel that I’d be compelled to slap de’ f**k outta you bro, for the people,” he said. “You’re a** kissing and bootlicking on a whole new level and I refuse to associate myself with something so vile, weak and inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you… now, I’m ashamed to have ever been associated with you.”</p><p>The read (most likely&nbsp;out of love and concern for Kanye) continued with Tip calling out Ye’s actions and skewed reasoning behind the meeting.</p><p>“As long as I’ve lived I’ve learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world, if to do so he must lose his soul,” he added. “We just saw Mr.West’s Soul on auction. If you listen closely you can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is I’ve reached my limits. This is my stop, I’m officially DONE! F**k Trump and his lil’ cookie boy.”</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Now I’ve been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about Ye’& his antics… Partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situations dealing wit my brother Wayne (which I admittedly mishandled a bit in hindsight) But now this shit is next level,futuristic Sambo,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!! From what I can gather… This is the most repulsive,disgraceful, Embarrassing act of desperation & auctioning off of one’s soul to gain power I’ve ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally)… but bro… if ain’time I would’ve been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence,I feel that I’d be compelled to slap de’Fuq outta you bro For the People!!! You ass kissing and boot licking on a whole new level &I refuse to associate myself with something so vile,weak,& inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE!!!! I’m a true believer in “It ain’t what you do,it’s how you do it.” And this shit is regurgitating! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you… now, I’m ashamed to have ever been associated with you. To all the people who follow Ye musically,socially, or even personally….who are confused, heartbroken, infuriated…. Let me make this clear… THIS SHIT AINT COOL!!! THIS IS A MOVE YE MADE FOR YE!!! THIS IS A PLAY TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION HE’D LIKE TO SEE HIMSELF IN…WE ARE NOT ON HIS MIND AS HE MAKES THESE COMMENTS AND DECISIONS. Don’t follow this puppet. Because as long as I’ve lived I’ve learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world,if to do so he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr.West’s Soul on auction. If you listen closely you can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is… I’ve reached my limits. This is my stop,I’m officially DONE!!!!
