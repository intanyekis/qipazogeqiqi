I get a little f****** jumpy, cause I don't want to blow it for my kids. I talk a little too loud, I don't act as cool as I can get."</p><p>Sandler adds, "So many smash hits, there isn't a word my kids don't know. Remember The Beatles? Every song on the record you knew.

I kind of like go through, you know when you talk to yourself in the mirror? And I'm like, 'They're not going to throw things at you, it's going to be OK, it's going to be OK.' It's not like that, it's more like, 'Mmm ... it's going to be OK?' I don't get nervous when I'm going on stage and a crowd of people have bought tickets to see me, because I'm like, 'You guys totally want to be here.' It's when I'm not sure if people want me to be on stage," she revealed back in 2012.</p><p>We assume the nervousness is still there, but Swift has handled it with nothing but grace and class.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYsCiusOlnKtlpJ28trPHrapmp55iwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecOuqaKml2K1qr%2BMoqWtnaKrtqbDjLCgraBdmLyvrc1mppuqmZq7br%2FUq6eroaOasW6ywKeqZqGeYsGpsYybnKysXayuunnPqKqsoZKhsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eva-pilgrim-what-to-know-about-amy-robachs-gma3-replacement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eva Pilgrim: What to Know About Amy Robach's 'GMA3' Replacement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-cohost-jeannie-mai-is-divorcing-freddy-harteis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Real' Cohost Jeannie Mai Is Divorcing Freddy Harteis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
