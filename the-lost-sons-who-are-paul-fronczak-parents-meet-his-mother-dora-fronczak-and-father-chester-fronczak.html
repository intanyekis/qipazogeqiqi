Fronczak finally succeeded in knowing that he was not the real baby Paul that his parents lost 56 years ago.</strong></p><p>Paul Fronczak is a man in his mid-fifties who works in a non-profit organization.</p><p>The story related to Paul is a rather interesting and a bit confusing one as you may say.</p><p>But it provides the feeling of a movie story with unexpected twists and turns that you begin to doubt if it is even real.</p><p>The investigation story details a newborn baby who gets stolen just a day after his birth which was recently shown in the film&nbsp;The Lost Sons.</p><p>Baby Paul, the main character of the story gets stolen from Michael Reese in 1964 and more than a half-century later, the actual truth unfolds.</p><p>Here we take a look at who are the actual parents of Paul Fronczak and such other related details.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paul-fronczak-parents-meet-his-mother-dora-fronczak-and-father-chester-fronczak></span>Paul Fronczak Parents: Meet His Mother Dora Fronczak And Father Chester Fronczak<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The actual Paul Fronczak was born to his mother Dora Fronczak and father Chester Fronczak.</p><p>Paul was born to his parents in Michael Reese hospital in 1964 but was stolen the very next day by a woman who dressed as a nurse.</p><p>The incident became national news and later a baby thought to be as Paul Fronczak was found abandoned in New Zersey.</p><p>Unsure if the found one was their actual baby, Dora and Chester adopted the baby and raised it as Paul but it turns out the found baby was a random one.</p><p>The now known Paul Fronczak grew up among his parents and a sibling but he didn’t look like any of them and felt alone from his teenage years.</p><p>Eventually, in 2012, the DNA testing proved that he was not the actual Paul and the hunt for the lost baby began.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-paul-fronczak-now></span>Where Is Paul Fronczak Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The actual Paul Fronczak who was stolen from the hospital died in 2020 due to COVID.</p><p>There are two Paul in this story, the real one stolen from the hospital and the one raised as Paul by the couple Dora and Chester.</p><p>The raised Paul Fronczak is still alive and is actively involved in non for profit organizational works.</p><p>Whereas, the real Paul who was stolen, later raised as Kevin Baty, is now dead after having COVID complications.</p><p>Chicago Suntimes&nbsp;reports the incident which reveals that the actual Paul never got to meet his mom Dora but they talked on the phone like two times.</p><p>Dora and Paul had later arranged to meet personally but the lost baby of 1964 passed away before that.</p><p class=postsid
