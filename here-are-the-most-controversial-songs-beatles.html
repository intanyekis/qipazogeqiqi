They were so big that they even created their own cultural weather system. Of course their fame comes with <a href=#>massive controversies on their career</a>. Throughout their career, the four-man band has had their fair share of hate from the media and politicians. The group was mainly controversial because of their song lyrics and remarks during their interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most controversial remarks made by the Beatles’ member is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stating that they were more popular than Jesus </a>suggesting that their level of fame outranks that of Jesus’. Other than their interviews, the other source of their controversies is their song lyrics. Take a look at some of the most controversial songs the Beatles’ has released.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Here's Why John Lennon Hated The Beatles Classic Let It Be">Here's Why John Lennon Hated The Beatles Classic Let It Be</a></span></p><h2 id=a-day-in-the-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>A Day In The Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beatles’ A Day In The Life suggests and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seems to encourage the listeners a permissive attitude towards drug-taking</a>. The song was included as the final track on Beatles’ 1967 album titled Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club. During the Rolling Stones interview with Paul McCartney, he admitted that the song was inspired by Tim Leary’s turn on, tune in, drop out, to which they included the line I’d love to turn you on in their song. All of them knew that it was a drug song but still went on with it. However, a lot of the listeners did not appreciate their word play including BBC. BBC decided to ban their song following its release in 1967. Upon learning that their song was banned, Lennon reportedly got angry and wanted to talk to the man who banned their song.</p><h2 id=run-for-your-life><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Run For Your Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beatles’ song Run For Your Life was not really appreciated because of the lines which suggests some ravings of a murderous psychopath. The song was included in Beatles’ 1965 album titled Rubber Soul which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">primarily written by John Lennon.</a> One of the lines that do not really sit well with the listeners is the line Well I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man. Obviously the song suggests possessiveness and if the girl leaves the guy, she’d be dead. It does suggest some psychopathic behavior and sounds really misogynistic.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="'The Beatles: Get Back': The Most Shocking Revelations From Peter Jackson's Documentary ">'The Beatles: Get Back': The Most Shocking Revelations From Peter Jackson's Documentary</a></span></p><h2 id=taxman><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taxman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song Taxman is <a href=#>about some evil of greed </a>and its impermanence of material things. The song is included in Beatles’ 1966 album Revolver, and it is basically about how Harrison who was making a lot of money during that time hated paying his dues and responsibilities to the government which is paying his taxes. Taxman gets the boot because it failed to distinguish itself on the musical aspect. The song suggests greed and obsessions for worldly possessions.</p><h2 id=the-ballad-of-john-and-yoko><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Ballad of John And Yoko</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">among the most controversial song of Beatles</a> as it was not played on numerous radio stations at the time it was released in 1969. The song was released as a non album single at the time. It caused a lot of controversy and although some stations played this song, they usually either censored or dubbed the taboo word used in the song. The song has a line Christ, you know it ain't easy, and using the word Christ at the time is taboo and unforgivable. Some stations may have chosen to play this song on air, but they have dubbed the word Christ as to not further infuriate people.</p><h2 id=woman-is-the-n-r-of-the-world><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Woman Is The N****r Of The World</span></h2><p>Upon hearing the title of this Beatles song, one would definitely cringe as it does not really sound good. The song was released as a single in 1972, and they also included it on the album Some Time In New York City. The song was not really that controversial during the time it was released however it is definitely creating some traction and controversies today. The title alone is a cringe worthy and shows the <a href=#>musician's take on regarding feminism</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="The Surprising 'Beatles' Member With The Biggest Solo Album">The Surprising 'Beatles' Member With The Biggest Solo Album</a></span></p><h2 id=give-ireland-back-to-the-irish><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Give Ireland Back To The Irish</span></h2><p>Beatles’ Give Ireland Back To The Irish is a Wings' song in the early 1972 and was controversial as soon as it was released. Although it was Wings who sang it, it was written by the Beatles’ member Paul McCartney. McCartney wrote the song in response to the news that the British troops deployed in Derry, Northern Ireland had shot thirteen civil rights marchers to death. A lot of the media members as well as politicians at the time labeled the song as a pro-IRA song or just a publicity stunt for McCartney’s new band. The song was deemed too provocative and was even banned throughout the entire country of Britain upon its release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-better><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Getting Better</span></h2><p>Getting Better was a song included on Beatles’ album titled Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band released on 1967. The song was not really controversial at the time it was released but has definitely <a href=#>gained some traction and negative feedback</a> today. The title might sound innocent but upon hearing the lyrics of the song, one would definitely cringe and will probably stop listening to the song altogether. One of the lyrics that does not sound right is the line I used to be cruel to my woman I beat her and kept her away from the things that she loved. The song basically suggests possessiveness and violence towards woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fixing-a-hole><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fixing A Hole</span></h2><p>Beatles’ Fixing a Hole is a song released on 1967 which was included on the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Super Deluxe Edition). The song does not really suggest misogyny, violence or political stance, but it suggests Beatles wanting to be away from their fans. It is never good to hate on your supporters and writing a song about it is not really acceptable. The song is about the members just wanting to relax and hang out while keeping the Beatlemaniacs away. This song might be the least controversial of their songs, but it is not a great look to hate on your die hard supporters.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="8 Bands Who Were Considered To Be The Next Beatles But Could Never Fill The Shoes">8 Bands Who Were Considered To Be The Next Beatles But Could Never Fill The Shoes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVYq6zsYytn55lnaTAtXnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2FyJqjZqufo7S0ecGemK2klah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./when-you-might-see-a-stars-moon-crossword-clue-nyt-99945124.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>When you might see a star's moon?
