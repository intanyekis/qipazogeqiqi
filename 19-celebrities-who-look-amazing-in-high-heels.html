Hidden at the bottom of a closet, just waiting to be pulled out for a showstopping performance - high heels are the nail in the coffin for most women's master plans. While not always comfortable, they can always pull together just about every outfit, adding that extra oomph to any look. Giving height and emphasizing all the right curves, heels are a shoe-shaped miracle in making any woman look and feel like a ten.</p><p>Heels come in all shapes and sizes. Platforms, kitten heels, stilettos, wedges, cone heels... the list literally goes on and on. Each different shoe has a certain time or place, and offers an endless repertoire of looks and experiences. As women have their favorites, so do men - but let's be real, as long as something isn't too garish or ugly we're not really going to complain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heels and Hollywood have a long legacy, with each era having their greatest shoe stars. Being a celebrity who wears heels well has as much to do with the confidence to sell it&nbsp;as it does having great legs. Heels are not the easiest shoe to wear (if you don't believe us, try it out for yourself!) and it's always a little obvious when someone hasn't quite figured out the balancing act of walking in them.</p><p>This list reflects some celebrities who manage to look really great in high heels, but we would love to hear who you think we might be missing.</p><h2 id=19-taylor-swift><strong>19. Taylor Swift</strong></h2><p>Becky with the good hair also has good legs. No actually, she has great legs. It's amazing that <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> can still manage to wow us even though she continues to hang out with some of the hottest supermodels in the world. Far more than just a pretty face with a great body and toned legs, she has the charisma and star power to win over any and every room. As much as we appreciate how great she looks here, what sells it is her complete and utter confidence. Not everyone can pull off a show stopping onesie with unusual maroon heels but hey, not everyone is Taylor Swift.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-selena-gomez><strong>18. Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p>Former Disney star,&nbsp;<a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>'s cute demeanor and almost virginal glow has long betrayed the fact she is smoking hot. While in many ways she does remind us of the cute top of the class student, she is working with so much more and has long been among the very best looking members of the former Mickey Mouse Club gang. While it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that she has legs for days (just take a look at the picture above), we're always kind of shocked at how perfectly formed Gomez's legs are (and the rest of her body for that manner). With some dancing in her background though, it would be more surprising if she didn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=17-kendall-jenner><strong>17. Kendall Jenner</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a> has slowly worked her way into being perhaps the most publicly recognizable Jenner-Kardashian in 2016, she still has a mysterious vibe that her sisters do not. Rather than just pursuing fame for the sake of it and being famous for being famous, Jenner has worked long and hard to pursue a career in high modeling and we gotta say - it's clearly working for her. When we think model we can't help thinking "legs for days" and Kendall certainly fulfills that requirement. Without coming across as too creepy, we're also impressed with Kendall's head to toe look - she has some good looking feet (not that we're into that... it's just, she does).</p><p></p><h2 id=16-rihanna><strong>16. Rihanna</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rihanna</a> is one of the most crushable celebrities out there. In many ways, the ultimate Manic Pixie Dream Girl, she is hot, cute, sexy, wild, smart, fashionable, mysterious and amazing (she is basically the whole package). Especially now that she's moved into directing her own music videos, she's far more than a triple threat. Rihanna has a seriously amazing body and as someone who knows how to dress, she is always choosing just the right shoe to sell any outfit. As much about the complete look as possible, she also always chooses something a little wild that clearly makes her feel her best.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=15-beyonce><strong>15. Beyonce</strong></h2><p>This list would not be complete with "THE" Queen Bee - <a href=#>Beyonce</a>. In many ways, Beyonce may very well be the most famous woman in the world representing a force to be reckoned with in terms of artistry, politics and overall beauty. Ever since her Destiny's Child days (don't they seem like so long ago?), she's had a killer body that has defied most of what Hollywood and celebrity has come to define as an "ideal". While for most women, Beyonce's body is just as unattainable as Taylor Swift's body is, that isn't to say she doesn't absolutely represent a breath of fresh air. She does apparently work hard to attain her body though, which also attests to her strong work ethic.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-jennifer-lopez><strong>14. Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> is literally pushing 50 years old and we can't make sense of it. Not only is she as hot as ever, she is implausibly hotter than some of the hottest young celebrities who are literally half her age. While Lopez has long proved herself to be more than just a pretty face, she has truly maintained her one in a billion figure that helped raise her from Jenny from the block. While her derriere has always attracted the most attention, there is no denying that she has some of the very best legs in the business and has always known when to pull them out for an absolute show stopping look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-blake-lively><strong>13. Blake Lively</strong></h2><p>Ryan Reynolds' beautiful wife,&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Lively</a>, has&nbsp;legs that could have been sculpted in marble by the greatest artists in history and we'd absolutely believe it. Everything about her ability to pull off heels screams old school glamor and impeccable style. We especially love these weird and almost velour slip-on heels she's sporting in the picture above, which by all accounts should look ridiculous on a lot of people.&nbsp;We honestly wouldn't even argue with someone who would say that she might have the very best legs in Hollywood history. Too far? Maybe.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-jennifer-aniston><strong>12. Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p>We can't be the only ones who are a little surprised that it's over a decade post-Friends&nbsp;and we're still talking about how hot <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> is? Aniston was never really the prettiest star, though she totally captures that perfect girl next door look. It was always something more, that kind of transcendent star quality that makes her pop and the fact that she has consistently had one of the best bodies in the business has obviously done nothing to hurt her. As important as having great legs are to look amazing in high heels, Aniston has also always been a very well dressed woman who plays to her strengths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-carrie-underwood><strong>11. Carrie Underwood</strong></h2><p>The new queen of country, <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>, has far more than a beautiful voice - she has the best legs this side of Nashville. Whenever we talk about a celebrity's ability to look as fit as possible because money pays for the best meals and trainers, we kind of have to believe that the same can apply to any of us who put our minds to it. Underwood, after all, has had amazing legs since she got her start in the American Idol talent competition - no personal trainer required. Obviously genetics and hard work play an important part, but Underwood is proof that you can work for the legs you want.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-chloe-sevigny><strong>10. Chloe Sevigny</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Chloe Sevigny</a> is the ultimate cool-girl. From a start in boundary-pushing indie projects to her integration into the mainstream, Sevigny has become an omnipotent force of cooldom. A little different than many women in her position, she has become an icon for weird-fashion, but as evidenced by her ability to clean up and pull together an outfit as depicted above that hasn't stopped her from killing it old school. Low-key Chloe Sevigny has some of the very best legs in the business and she is very much willing to show them off. Not one to shy away from laying it bare on the screen (she infamously performed fellatio on actor/director <a href=#>Vincent Gallo</a> in the Brown Bunny) we're not complaining that she is willing to share her assets with the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-zendaya><strong>9. Zendaya</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Zendaya</a> is down-low, one of our biggest celebrity crushes. Just twenty years old, Zendaya has made a name for herself as a Disney channel star and a pretty vocal political activist. Smart and beautiful, she has won over our hearts a long time ago and has already established herself as a very promising starlet. Still a little underestimated, we're still waiting for her big break beyond teen and tween audiences and we have the utmost confidence that she will deliver and make us proud. Unsurprisingly, Zendaya also works as a model - with those legs it would be a crime if she didn't.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-chrissy-teigen><strong>8. Chrissy Teigen</strong></h2><p>Our favourite big-name couple right now is <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> and <a href=#>John Legend</a>. We don't normally follow the dating lives of stars, but there is something about their matchup that just feels so right. If you know anything about heeled beauties you shouldn't be surprised that a swimsuit model makes our list, since one of the greatest skills a swimsuit model can have is to work her body as if she was wearing the highest heels in the sand, barefoot, while being hit by waves. We love her curves, her sass and the way she owns what she wears no matter what she is wearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-gigi-hadid><strong>7. Gigi Hadid</strong></h2><p>2016 has been a huge year for model Gigi Hadid. While One Direction fans have known who she is for a little while (since she is reportedly currently dating&nbsp;<a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>) the rest of the world has been a little behind on this stunning beauty. Just 21 years old she has already been named one of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition's upcoming rookies, she's also integrated herself into the inner circle of Taylor Swift's girl posse (and we all know how prestigious that is in the world of fame). Gigi Hadid has all the potential to become a huge supermodel and her legs are leading the way.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-stacy-keibler><strong>6. Stacy Keibler</strong></h2><p>Former WWE star, <a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a>, has insured her best assets for at least a million dollars. Since this includes a whole lot of paperwork and physical exams, this is no small feat and that number really speaks for itself. Keibler has some of the best gams we've ever seen (not only on the red carpet, but ever). They are not just long, slender and shapely but incredibly muscular as well. They are the product of hard work and a big reason why she's the star she is today. Stacy is super adorable and we love that she is thinking about the long game by protecting her important investments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-heidi-klum><strong>5. Heidi Klum</strong></h2><p>Speaking of insuring your best assets, you might have thought that Stacy Keibler's million dollar plus evaluation is nothing compared to the two million dollar policy <a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> has put into her legs. While it's weird at first to wrap your head around insuring a specific body part, it really makes sense when that's your bread and butter. We gotta give Klum credit too, as one of the most beautiful women in the world, she still has some pretty exceptional legs and she knows how to dress them up in the best way possible. Heidi Klum is remarkably in her forties but we would never guess based on how amazing she looks all the time!</p><p></p><h2 id=4-rosie-huntington-whiteley><strong>4. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</strong></h2><p>We were never 100% sold on <a href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a> replacing Megan Fox in the Transformers franchise... but we gotta say, one thing she outdoes Megan Fox on is legs. That isn't to say that <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> doesn't look great in high heels, but she just doesn't wear them with the same grace and power as Rosie does. It shouldn't surprise anyone that this list has so many models, who rely so much on looking good and walking well in heels better than most. Having the best possible legs is also a huge part of the deal, especially if you want to rise above the herd and make a name for yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-amber-heard><strong>3. Amber Heard</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Amber Heard</a> is stunning - one of those classic beauties who would actually fit during any era. We can imagine her as clearly as the star of a 1930s movie, as one from the 1970s and as one in today's era. While her face is clearly her bread and butter, she has always had some eye-grabbing legs and she really knows how to work them. We love how sculpted and muscular they are, assets only amplified by her high heels. She's always been one of the most fit actresses we've seen on screen and has made a good career showing off the very best she has to offer, on and off the screen.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-sophie-turner><strong>2. Sophie Turner</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sophie Turner</a>&nbsp;(aka Sansa Stark) has quickly become one of the hottest women in the world. While it is a little creepy that we literally watched her grow up onscreen, the kind of slow boil of Game of Thrones alleviates at least some of that tension. On a television show with so many incredibly beautiful women (many of whom are often and literally laid bare) it's no small feat that Sophie has managed to really stand out and make a name for herself. While we are not complaining about Sophie's commitment to Game of Thrones, we are also excited by the idea that she will eventually break out as a star in other movies and television. At just twenty years old we also feel like she will only refine and polish her look too, so we're excited for that as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-emily-ratajkowski><strong>1. Emily Ratajkowski</strong></h2><p>We're not sure when's the last time a star made such a huge impact by just appearing in a music video. When&nbsp;<a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski</a> emerged out of <a href=#>Robin Thicke</a>'s 'Blurred Lines', she quickly became an instant star based solely on how hot and adorable she came across. As someone who has a statement body, this is the kind of thing that works from head to toe and she honestly seems like someone who has more legs than anything else... and heels only make that more pronounced. Emily knows how to make heels work for her in the best way possible and while we also like her a little umm... undressed, she really knows how to work a runway and an outfit.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>New York Daily News</a>, <a href=#>IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqcV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mo6inm2Kurq3ZoqWgZZmjeqm1xqFkoZ2VocBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carl-thompson-obituary-cherished-student-of-kinsella-magnet-high-school-has-sadly-passed-away.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carl Thompson Obituary, Cherished Student Of Kinsella Magnet High School Has Sadly Passed Away</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./762887-wwe-no-mercy-result-carmella-vs-nikki-bella.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWE No Mercy Result: Carmella vs Nikki Bella</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
