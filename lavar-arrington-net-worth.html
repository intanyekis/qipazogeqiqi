LaVar is best known for his career as a former professional American Football player in the NFL for the Washington Redskins (2000–2005) and the New York Giants (2006). His net worth is largely attributed to his successful sports career and his current ventures in radio hosting and sports agency ownership.</p><p>LaVar was born on the 20th of June 1978, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. He grew up in his hometown and attended North Hills Senior High School, where he excelled in football, basketball, and track & field. He continued his football career at Penn State University, earning several honors and awards during his time there.</p><p>In 2000, LaVar’s professional playing career began when he was selected as the second overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He later moved to the New York Giants in 2006, signing a substantial contract, but suffered from injuries that led to his release and eventual retirement in 2007.</p><p>Following his retirement, LaVar pursued a career in broadcasting and also ventured into business, founding his sports agency, Leap Management, LLC, and Xtreme Procision, a football training program. These ventures have also contributed significantly to his net worth.</p><p>Off the field, LaVar is married to Trishia, and they have three children.
