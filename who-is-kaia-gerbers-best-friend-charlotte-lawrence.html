Over the years, she's hung out with Harry Styles, Tommy Dorfman, Lori Laughlin's daughters, Cara Delevingne and even Once Upon A Time In Hollywood star Margaret Qualley (with whom she shares an ex-boyfriend). Then, of course, there are all the famous men she's been attached to including Pete Davidson and Euphoria's Jacob Elordi. When you're <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford (and have her looks)</a> as well as are creating a massive modeling career for yourself, you can have your pick of the litter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Pics Of Kaia Gerber When She Thought No One Was Looking (And 3 With Pete Davidson)</a></span></p><p>While there are many<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> stunning photos of Kaia Gerber that are sure to make Pete Davidson miss her</a>, she can often be upstaged by her stunning best-friend, Charlotte Lawrence.</p><p>If that name doesn't ring a bell, it soon will. Charlotte is a major rising star in the music and entertainment industry. But just who is she?</p><p>Let's find out...</p><h2 id=like-her-bestie-kaia-charlotte-is-the-daughter-of-royalty>Like Her Bestie Kaia, Charlotte Is The Daughter Of Royalty</h2><p>Kaia Gerber was born into immense wealth. Not only is her mom a supermodel but her dad, Rande Gerber, is an insanely successful businessman. Charlotte Lawrence was born into a similar status.</p><p>Charlotte, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, is the daughter of Christa Miller, best known for her leading role on The Drew Carey Show. As for her father, well, he's Bill Lawrence, an incredibly successful Hollywood producer. Bill is the creator of Scrubs, co-creator of Spin City, Cougar Town, and Clone High. He's also been a writer on The Nanny and the beloved Boy Meets World.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=building-a-career-for-herself>Building A Career For Herself</h2><p>While Charlotte Lawrence first got noticed by the paparazzi as a recognizable face partying with the likes of her bestie Kaia and The Jenner girls, she has quickly begun carving out a career for herself.</p><p>Specifically, Charlotte profits off the fact that she's a total babe... AKA modeling. Not only that, but she's already become a very recognizable and beloved singer, especially amongst Gen Z. She has released several hit singles, such as "Navy Blue", "Keep Me Up", and "Psychopath". Charlotte also released her first album "Young" in June 2018 and her song "Joke's On You" was featured on The Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey soundtrack. All of this has contributed to her crushing Spotify's 50 Global Chart and sell out stadiums across North America.</p><p>Fans of Charlotte's music are particularly drawn to her edgy vocals, suggestive and ethereal music videos, and the fact that she's not a cookie-cutter, Disney pop star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlotte grew her musical talents (as well as her interest in the career choice) when she was a youngster. She would often jam with her mother, according to Vanity Fair, who would set up performances at her dinner parties that featured a ton of Grammy winners. In an interview with VF, Charlotte said,&nbsp;“At 13, I played for my music idols and worked hard until I was confident that this wasn’t just a hobby.”</p><p>All of this helped Charlotte grow her confidence as she insists she was a very shy young woman. All of this is surprising given her career path as well as the fact that modeling scouts were all over her...</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Fendi</a>, Charlotte Lawrence has repped brands like Marie Claire, Vogue and Teen Vogue. With her frame and stunning looks, we can see why so many established brands have taken a strong interest in her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-everywhere-with-her-famous-friends>She Was Everywhere With Her Famous Friends</h2><p>The pandemic has changed a lot in Charlotte Lawrence's life. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">coming down with COVID-19</a>, Charlotte took to her successful Instagram feed to remind her followers to keep their distance, wear a mask, and stay home if possible.</p><p>"We have the power to slow this down. So please, please isolate yourself," she said on Instagram. She then added, "Stay clean. Stay informed. Stay aware and make others aware. And for the love of God, self f***ing quarantine or you'll be on my s*** list."</p><p>Therefore, Charlotte has not really been spotted out with her friends, including Kaia who is basically everywhere with Jacob Elordi nowadays.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Pics Of Cindy Crawford And Rande Gerber’s Kids Proving How Fast They’re Growing Up</a></span></p><p>Previous to the global pandemic, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlotte was also romantically linked to singer Charlie Puth</a>. The two were extremely quiet about their relationship status, but it was clear that they were in a committed, long-term relationship... until the beginning of Summer 2020. We don't know what went down between them, but Charlie and Charlotte are now both reportedly single.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before all of this happened, Charlotte was causing us all to have BFF jealousy. She and Kaia Gerber have been spotted out for dinner, at parties, at the beach, protesting together, and on extravagant holidays with each other's families.</p><p>When everything starts going back to normal, we hope to see Charlotte out with her famous friend again.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaia Gerber Takes Tattoos One Step Further… She Inks Herself While In Quarantine!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8CimGaflaevpr7SZpmeq6Ris7O1xKebZpuYlr%2Btu9OtnGakkay%2FprrCnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aaron-carter-cause-of-death-net-worth-instagram-age-sister-youngbiography-wikipedia-family-youtube-career-nationality.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aaron Carter Cause Of Death, Net Worth, Instagram, Age, Sister, YoungBiography, Wikipedia, Family, Y</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-cast-of-girl-meets-world-up-to-now-sabrina-carpenter-rowan-blanchard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What The Cast Of Girl Meets World Is Up To Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
