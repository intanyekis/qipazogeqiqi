From interviewing pop culture icons like Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Elizabeth Taylor to orchestrating that legendary Pontiac G6 giveaway in 2004, the now 69-year-old talk show host's iconic show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ran in nationwide syndication for nearly three decades, was <a href=#>responsible for some truly iconic TV moments</a>.</p><p>But there were also countless times when <a href=#>Oprah’s interactions with guests went completely sideways</a>, resulting in some pretty cringeworthy moments. One such awkward exchange occurred in 1986 when Oprah sat down with the iconic supermodel Cindy Crawford.</p><p>During an episode of Apple TV's docuseries, Super Models, Crawford opened up about her sit-down with the legendary talk show host, accusing her of treating her like "chattel" by demanding that she show off her body on television.

Featuring interviews with the likes of Beyoncé, Whitney Houston, and Michael Jackson, the show continues to influence pop culture discourse over a decade since it concluded its daytime TV run. But it's not just its most iconic moments that keep popping back up.</p><p>From that awkward interview with the Olsen twins, where Oprah repeatedly prodded them to discuss their size while they were battling an eating disorder, to that bizarre sit-down with Top Gun star Tom Cruise, plenty of regrettable interviews from the show have resurfaced over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oprah-winfrey-in-a-shiny-suit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet another regrettable interview that’s come back to haunt Oprah is her 1986 sit-down with supermodel Cindy Crawford. Then just 20 years old, Crawford was yet to become one of the most renowned supermodels in history, and was making her debut appearance on the show alongside her Elite Modeling Agency rep, John Casablancas.</p><p>In a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> resurfaced clip from the show</a>, Oprah introduces Crawford to the audience, before posing a few questions about her career. Curiously, the now 69-year-old opted to direct most of her questions to Casablancas. “So did you have to groom her?,” she inquired. “Did she always have this body?

She didn’t see, I think as clearly as we did the potential that she had. So it’s been a very slow process… little by little, her ambition is growing,” Casablancas responded. “She's getting a sense, and I'm saying it now on this program, if she wants to she can be number one in the business.”</p><p>Though Crawford tried to interject with her own perspective on her career, Winfrey seemed intent on having Casablancas speak on her behalf.</p><p>Crawford would look back on the interview decades later on an episode of Apple TV’s Super Models, where she’d call out Winfrey for asking her to show off her body on national television.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-cindy-crawford-ever-forgive-oprah-for-treating-her-like-chattel-during-an-interview-on-her-show_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was like the chattel or a child, be seen and not heard,” she said. “When you look at it through today’s eyes, Oprah’s like, ‘Stand up and show me your body.
