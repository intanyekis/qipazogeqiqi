She is the winner of an Emmy and Peabody award and currently hosts Spain and Company&nbsp;on ESPN radio.

In the past, she had made&nbsp;several&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentions</a> regarding her height. But most of them were just casual references to her height from when she was young and never completely revealed it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In one reply to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@minakimes</a>&nbsp;about weighing 9 pounds as a baby, Sarah replied that she was only 6&nbsp;pounds. She then followed that by asking back how long it took her to pass Mina Kimes&nbsp;in height and weight; alluding to the fact that Sarah was much taller than Mina Kimes.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>(Yes, my height would've been a distinct advantage if heights had increased, but also it would just make for more interesting competition.) — Sarah Spain (@SarahSpain) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 16, 2016</a></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>, Sarah wrote, "Yes, my height would've been a distinct advantage if heights had increased, but also it would just make for more interesting competition." While this statement was out of context to know what she was really talking about, this thread is where she went on to reveal her actual height.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@24_Miguel_24</a>&nbsp;asked Sarah what her height was, she immediately replied that she was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">6 feet</a> tall.&nbsp;Her straight-to-the-point answer put to rest any further&nbsp;height discussion about her.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>How tall are you? — Miguel Alfaro (@24_Miguel_24) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">June 12, 2018</a></p><p>This is not all. In a later tweet the following <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">year</a>, Sarah mentioned that she was already her full height of 6 feet when she was 12! This comment came when she was watching a 12-year old kid on Jimmy Fallon's show and was taken aback by the fact that the kid was roughly the same size as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Danny DeVito</a>. DeVito is 4 feet 10 inches tall.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Okay, this 12-year-old kid on Fallon is weirding me out. He acts 7 & is roughly the same height as Danny Devito. I was 6 feet tall at 12! — Sarah Spain (@SarahSpain) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">January 27, 2017</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>If Sarah's comments are to be taken at face value, this makes Sarah<span>&nbsp;much taller than the&nbsp;women's&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>national average</span></a><span> height of 5’4 in the US.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span>Sarah Sets 'Tall' Standards For Her Men</span></h2><p><span>It is natural to think that someone as attractive and tall as Sarah Spain would have 'high' standards (pun intended). Sarah seems to be particularly attracted to tall men or even wished other celebrities were taller than they actually were.</span></p><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> particular tweet, Sarah wished just this. Her comment came with regards to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Muppets'Speicals&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">performance</a> with Lady Gaga. After watching the special, she tweeted the statement, "If only JGL were about 8 inches taller..."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When asked by&nbsp;@RedheadLorri for Sarah to look past JGL's height, Sarah agreed that while she loved the actor in every way, she just wished he was taller.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Then another one of her followers,&nbsp;@RealJPB, asked her, "why 8 inches?" since it only took 3 more inches for the actor to come to Sarah's height. Sarah's reply would not only answer the question but also go on to reveal her relationship status.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><span>Sarah's reply confirmed that her boyfriend, at the time, was 6’5".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sarah's own height seems to be the reason she is so particular in her height <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">preferences</a>, as she also mentioned&nbsp;in another reply: “I'm 6 feet tall! I'm allowed to want 'em tall!”</span></p><h2>Meet Brad Zibung:&nbsp;Sarah's Partner Who Fulfilled Her Wishes</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>The 6 feet 5-inch boyfriend that Sarah had revealed in 2013 could most definitely be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brad Zibung</a>, who is also&nbsp;now her husband. Sarah and Brad&nbsp;</span>got married in May of 2016, as Sarah’s 2020 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a> suggests.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah also mentioned in the post she has been with Brad&nbsp;for a good total of 11 years. This&nbsp;means that the “boyfriend” in Sarah’s 2013 tweets could very well be Brad himself.</p>Currently, Brad is a real estate agent and the founder of the satirical sports newspaper <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The&nbsp;Heckler</a>. The Heckler posits no affiliation to any sports team and is largely satirical in their reporting. While relatively lesser known than their sports magazine counterparts, the sattirical newspaper has also been featured in other large media outlets such as&nbsp;the Chicago Sun-Times,&nbsp;Fox Chicago, and ESPN Radio.&nbsp;<p>Given Sarah's portfolio as a sports journalist herself, it&nbsp;does not take much to deduce that Brad and she are not just fitting partners in height but fitting partners in crime.&nbsp;In any case, Sarah seems to have got the tall man she always wanted<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno5a%2ForSMrKeaoZ6oeqnB0puYp5xdlrSmeceeoKCgpGO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ted-dibiase-htm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ted DiBiase - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosie-huntington-whiteley-advises-fans-to-save-1-a-week-for-700-shoes-2011911.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Tells Fans to Save $1 a Week for $700 Shoes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-nick-and-zack-martin-brothers.html>Are Nick and Zack Martin Brothers?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-travis-scott-and-sza-dating-their-chemistry-in-new-music-video-sparks-dating-rumors.html>Are Travis Scott And SZA Dating?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ritchie-torres.html>Ritchie Torres Wiki Biography, Parents, Age, Family, Ethnicity, Instagram &amp;amp; Many More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./victoria-prince.html>Victoria Prince News - Us Weekly</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./you-showrunner-says-jenna-ortega-could-return-in-future-seasons.html>You Showrunner Says Jenna Ortega Could Return in Future Seasons</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingB.
