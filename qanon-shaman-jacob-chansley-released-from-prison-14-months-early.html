shirtless in a horned coyote-fur headdress on Jan. 6, 2021 — has been released from prison 14 months early and moved to a halfway house in Phoenix, Ariz., prison officials said Thursday.</p><p>Jacob Chansley, 35, who became the poster boy of the Capitol riot, had been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced to 3 1/2 years in federal prison</a> but served just over 2 years before he was set free on Tuesday, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons.</p><p>“It is appropriate this gentle and intelligent young man be permitted to move forward with the next stage of what undoubtedly will be a law abiding and enriching life,” Chansley’s former lawyer Albert Watkins said in a statement. &nbsp;</p><p>“I applaud the decision of the US Bureau of Prison in this regard,” he said..</p><figure

class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">He pleaded guilty to civil disorder and violent entry to the Capitol in September 2021. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Chansley, of Phoenix, pleaded guilty&nbsp;to one count of obstructing an official proceeding before Congress&nbsp;in September 2021.</p><p>His release comes just weeks after new video evidence emerged showing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Capitol cops escorting Chansley</a> down the halls of the building and through the doors of the US Senate, prompting Watkins to demand his onetime client be freed.</p><p>The footage drew skepticism about whether “The Shaman” was&nbsp;a real threat&nbsp;during his entry of the Capital&nbsp; — though it was not clear what led to his early release, and Watkins didn’t immediately return The Post’s request for comment.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Chansley was released from prison 14 months early and moved to a halfway house, his lawyer said Thursday. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>Chansley, who suffers from mental health problems, served 11 months in solitary confinement during his prison stint, according to Watkins.</p><p>He is now living in a Residential Reentry Center in Phoenix with a release date of May 25, according to a BOP spokesperson.</p><p>The last court filing in his case is an order granting a probation petition, signed by Judge Royce Lamberth on Jan. 20.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jacob Chansley, 35, became the notorious poster boy of the Jan. 6 riot. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>As a condition of his release, Chansley must submit “to a search” of his home, car or other property by a parole officer, according to the court document.</p><p>“Failure to submit to a search may be grounds for revocation of release,” it states.</p><p>&nbsp;A BOP spokesperson said the bureau does not “discuss the conditions of confinement for any inmate, including&nbsp;transfers&nbsp;or release plans.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jacob Chansley is seen with Capitol police during the Jan. 6 riot. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>But federal inmates sometimes receive shortened sentences due to “good conduct time,” the rep said.</p><p>Chansley was among the first rioters to enter the Capitol with fellow supporters of former President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>He entered the Senate chamber and sat at the desk of the Senate president then refused to leave when ordered to by enforcement officials, according to prosecutors. “Mike Pence is a f—king traitor,” he snapped at the officers.</p><p>Chansley also left a menacing note on Vice President Mike Pence’s Senate desk declaring, “Justice is coming,” according to prosecutors.</p><p>He has since said he no longer supports Trump.</p><p>In May 2021, he was ordered by a judge to undergo a psychological evaluation, and has said he believes he’s “directly related to Jesus and Buddha,” Watkins said at the time.</p><p>Chansley is among the most widely recognizable faces of the roughly 1,000 criminal defendants who were charged for their roles in the Capitol attack.</p><p class=postsid
